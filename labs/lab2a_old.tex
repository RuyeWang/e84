{\Large \bf E84 Lab 2: Construction of a Radio Receiver}

%{\bf Final construction due 5 pm, last day of class, paper submission due one week earlier}

Pick up the hardware of the radio receiver kit from the stock room,
including all the components and the construction manual.

\section{Part 1: Transistor Circuits}

\subsection{Transistor Testing}

Different types of transistors are used in the 
\htmladdnormallink{AM/FM radio receiver kit}{../amfm108TK.pdf}
of this lab, including five
\htmladdnormallink{2N3904}{http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/2N/2N3904.pdf}
transistors (also available in the stock room). Use the 
\htmladdnormallink{Type 575 semiconductor curve tracer}{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_curve_tracer}
in the electronic lab to test these transistors in common emitter mode. 
Specifically, observe both the input and output characteristic plots.

{\bf Important note:} To make sure you do not burn your transistor, 
(a) study the datasheet of the transistor to determine the leads for E, B and C,
(b) do not apply $V_{CC}$ voltage higher than 30 V.

{\bf Initial control knob settings before you start:}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Display control} (top-right)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Vertical axis (for $I_B$ or $I_C$): 1 mA/Div
  \item Horizontal axis ($V_{BE}$ or ``base voltage''): 0.1 or 0.5 V/Div
  \item Horizontal axis ($V_{CE}$ or ``collector voltage''): 2 V/Div
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf Collector voltage} (lower-left)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Peak voltage range: x1 (be careful to use x10 as maximum voltage is 200 V!)
  \item Polarity: + for npn transistors
  \item Peak Volt ($V_{CC}$): 10 to 20 Volts
  \item Dissipation limiting resistor ($R_C$): 1 k$\Omega$
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf Base voltage} (lower-right)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Repetitive/Single scan: repetitive
  \item Steps/family: 12
  \item Polarity: +
  \item Steps/Sec: 240
  \item Series resistor ($R_B$) (no relevance here)
  \item Step selection: $0.005 mA = 5 \mu A$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transistor Circuit Construction}

Design and build the basic transistor voltage amplifier shown in the figure
below to achieve maximum voltage amplification and minimum distortion. (Use
$V_{CC}\le 20\;V$.) Test the circuit by a signal generator and an oscilloscope.
($R_S$ in the diagram represents the output rersistance of the signal generator 
as the voltage source.) Calculate the DC operating point based on your design,
and verify it in the actual circuit. Display both input and output signals
(sinusoidal) on the screen (use both channels). Observe the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item DC operating point (should be in the middle of the load line)
\item Voltage amplification
\item Polarity inversion
\item The upper and lower peak clipping (by increasing the amplitude of 
  the input sinusoid).
\item Bypass $R_E$ with a capacitor of different $C$ values to observe the voltage amplification as a function of the signal frequency as well as $C$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Submission:}

\begin{itemize}
\item The sketch or photo of both the input and output characteristic plots 
  observed on the screen of the semiconductor curve tracer with the following
  clear labeled (with meaningful increment):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The voltage (horizontal axis) $V_{BE}$ or $V_{CE}$
  \item The current (vertical axis) $I_B$ or $I_C$
  \item For the output plot, each one of the 12 $I_B$ values in the family
  \end{itemize}
\item Determine the value $\beta=I_C/I_B$ (also referred to as the 
  ``forward transfer current ratio'' and denoted by $h_f$ or $h_{FE}$ on
  the \htmladdnormallink{2N3904 datasheet}{http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/2N/2N3904.pdf}
  (also see \htmladdnormallink{class notes}{http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e84/lectures/ch4/node7.html})
  from the output plot for each of the 5 transistors.
\item Determine $V_{BE}$ from the input plot when $I_B$ is within the range of
  0.01 to 0.1 mA, i.e., $I_C$ is within the range of $0.01\;\beta$ to $0.1\;\beta$.
\item Describe how the load line changes in the output plot when $R_C$ and $V_{CC}$
  increases/decreases.
\item Determine the voltage gain of the transistor ampilfier. Submit the sketch
  or photo of the oscilloscpoe showing both input and output at the same time.
\item Submit the sketch or photo of the oscilloscpoe display showing both input and output at the same time. Specify the voltage gain of the ampilfier.
\end{itemize}
