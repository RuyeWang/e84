E84 Lab 1: Design of a Multimeter</A>
</H1>

<P>
The schematic diagram of a multimeter is shown in the figure below:
<IMG
 ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" SRC="../MultimeterA2.gif"
 ALT="MultimeterA2.gif">

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Pick up the hardware of the multimeter kit from the stock room,
    including all the components (resistors, potentiometer, meter head, 
    rotary switch, batteries, etc.). 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Study the diagram above carefully to understand how the meter 
    measures the voltages, currents and resistances at each of the positions 
    of the rotary switch. The rectangular shape to the left of the meter 
    head (a circle with an arrow in it) represents two parallel diodes 
    with opposite polarity for the protection of the meter head. You don't
    need to worry about this. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The part marked by 10KBVR is a potentiometer, a resistor of 10
    <IMG
 WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img21.png"
 ALT="$K\Omega$"> but with an additional terminal which is a piece of metal 
    that can slide along the resistor, so that the resistance between the 
    3rd terminal and any of the other two is variable between 0 and 10 
    <IMG
 WIDTH="35" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img21.png"
 ALT="$K\Omega$">. See
    <A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiometer">here</A>
for more detailed explanation. This potentiometer is needed to calibrate
    the Ohmmeter. Specifically, before taking the measurement of a resistance,
    the potentiometer needs to be adjusted so that the needle points to 
    zero on the resistance scale when the two leads of the multimeter touch
    each other for zero resistance.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Understand how the rotary switch works. It is represented by the 
    18 circles on top of the diagram and the two layers of rectangular shapes
    on the bottom. At each of the 18 positions, the corresponding circle on 
    top is connected to both of the rectangles, while all remaining circles 
    are not connected to anything. If you still have difficulty understanding 
    this, it should be most helpful if you take a look at the physical parts 
    and the printed circuit board (PCB) in the kit.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Find the resistance for each of the 13 resistors with their values 
    erased.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Turn in your design on paper with all the resistance values before
    the first deadline. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Assemble the multimeter in the lab, verify every single position 
    to see if the meter works as expected.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<B>Hints</B> 

<P>
Following these steps:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Study the meter head assembly circuitry and find out the needed voltage 
  across the meter in series with the <IMG
 WIDTH="51" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img25.png"
 ALT="$190\; \Omega$"> resistor for the current 
  through the meter to be <IMG
 WIDTH="54" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img26.png"
 ALT="$43 \;\mu A$">, needed for a full scale display. Then 
  find the currents through the two parallel branches with the resistances of 
  <IMG
 WIDTH="53" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img27.png"
 ALT="$32\; k\Omega$"> and <!-- MATH
 $10+18=28\;k\Omega$
 -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="138" HEIGHT="35" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img28.png"
 ALT="$10+18=28\;k\Omega$">. Next find the total current needed 
  by this meter assembly composed of all three parallel branches for a 
  full-scale meter display. This current can be used through out the calculation 
  in the following steps.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Find the resistances needed to measure the currents and voltages at all
  scales.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Find out what values are needed for the upper and lower resistances of the 
  potentiometer during the calibration of the ohmmeter, i.e. when the two leads
  of the meter are directly connected (short circuit with zero resistance) for a 
  full-scale display.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Find the resistances needed to measure an unknown resistor value at all
  four scales. Note that the middle value of the resistance measurement is 20, 
  200, 20k, or 200k <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="16" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img20.png"
 ALT="$\Omega$"> for each of the scales, and the corresponding 
  current through the meter assembly should be half of the current needed for 
  a full scale display.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<B>How to find the polarity of a diode? (not necessarily trivial!)</B>

<P>
When the voltage at the anode (labeled by a triangle) of a diode is higher
than that of the cathode, the diode has a very low resistance (close to a short
circuit, called forward biased). If the polarity is reversed, the resistance 
of the diode becomes very high (close to an open circuit, called reverse biased).
The polarity of the diode can therefore be found by checking its resistance 
using a multimeter.

<P>
However, we need to know which lead of the multimeter (when used as an ohmmeter) 
is positive and which is negative. In most analog multimeters, such as the one 
you are building, the positive lead (marked by +) is connected to the negative 
end of the internal battery, while the other lead (marked by -, or COM for common)
is connected to positive end of the battery. So if the measured resistance of the 
diode is low, the end connected to the COM lead of the multimeter is the anode
(triangle).

<P>
However, the polarities of digital multimeters may be the opposite, i.e., the 
lead marked by + may be connected to the positive end of the internal battery.
In this case, the polarity of the diode can be determined in the opposite way
compared to the method above using an analog multimeter. 

<P>
Moreover, some digital multimeters have a particular position for diode measurement.
