<P>
An electrocardiograph (ECG or EKG) plots the electrical 
activity of the heart over time. The following oscilloscope
trace shows a typical EKG waveform. The spikes are called the
QRS complex and correspond to muscle contraction during heart
beats, with a typical interval of 0.5-1 second depending on 
subject's heart rate. The signal is very small, on the order 
of a few milli-volts, and the source impedance is high.

<P>
Build a two-input EKG signal amplifier based on an instrumentation
amplifier discussed in

<P>
Be aware that there may exist some small but non-zero DC offset 
voltage between the two signal electrodes. You may need to 
carefully adjust the overall gain of your instrumentation 
amplifier (by properly selecting the values of the resistors 
all in kilo-ohm range), so that it is large enough to amplify 
the desired AC EKG signal for it to be clearly observable, but
not too large so that the DC component of the output is not 
pushed to either the top or bottom rail, in which case the AC 
signal is no longer observable.

<P>
Also, your circuit may pick up some 50 Hz interference in the 
environment, which is to be filtered out in a future lab.

<P>
Two adhesive electrodes (available in the lab) go on your upper 
chest, above and to the left and right of your heart. A third 
reference electrode goes on your lower abdomen and connects to 
ground of your circuit. You may find it easiest to connect to
them with alligator clips and long wires. The signal of interest
is the difference between the two electrodes. Your circuit should
amplify the signal so that it is readable on the oscilloscope.

<P>
Submit a brief written report containing the following items:

<UL>
<LI>The circuit with all resistance values
</LI>
<LI>The calculated gain and the actual gain
</LI>
<LI>A print-out of the amplified EKG signal as the output of 
  the amplifier
</LI>
<LI>A description of the EKG signal in terms of its amplitude, 
  DC offset, and frequency. 
</LI>
</UL>

amplifier:
