\section*{}

All voltages and currents are represented as phasors.
\[ V(x)-V(x+dx)=I(x)j\omega L^* dx,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;I(x)-I(x+dx)=V(x+dx)j\omega C^* dx \]
\[ \frac{dV(x)}{dx}=-I(x)j\omega L^*,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\frac{dI(x)}{dx}=-V(x)j\omega C^* \]
Taking the derivative of the first equation and substituting it into the second, we get
\[ \frac{d^2V(x)}{dx^2}=-j\omega L^*\frac{dI(x)}{dx}=-\omega^2L^*C^* V(x)=-k^2V(x) \]
where
\[ k=\omega\sqrt{L^*C^*}=\frac{\omega}{\omega_0},
\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\omega_0=\frac{1}{\sqrt{L^*C^*}} \]
The general solution of this harmonic oscillator equation is
\[ V(x)=V_fe^{jkx}+V_be^{-jkx} \]
and we have
\[ \frac{dV(x)}{dx}=jk V_fe^{jkx}-jk V_b e^{-jkx}=-I(x)j\omega L^*  \]
Solving for $I(x)$ we get
\[ I(x)=-\frac{k}{\omega L^*}(V_fe^{jkx}-V_b e^{-jkx})
=\sqrt{\frac{C^*}{L^*}} (V_fe^{jkx}-V_b e^{-jkx})=\frac{V(x)}{Z_C} \]
where
\[ Z_C=\sqrt{{L^*}{C^*}} \]
is the {\em characteristic impedance} of the transmission line, which relates the 
voltage $V(x)$ and current $I(x)$ in the transmission line by generalized Ohm's 
law $V(x)=Z_C I(x)$.

Given the phasor representations $V(x)$ and $I(x)$, we can find the corresponding
voltage $v(x,t)$ and current $i(x,t)$ in time domain as
\[ v(x,t)=Re[\sqrt{2} V(x) e^{j\omega t}]=\sqrt{2}[V_f\cos(\omega t+kx)+V_b\cos(\omega t-kx)] \]
\[ i(x,t)=Re[\sqrt{2} I(x) e^{j\omega t}]=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{Z_C}[V_f\cos(\omega t+kx)+V_b\cos(\omega t-kx)] \]



\section*{The voltage and current wave equations}

As shown in the figure, a transmission line can be modeled by its 
resistance and inductance in series, and the conductance and capacitance
in parallel, all distributed along its length in $x$ direction. Here $R$,
$L$, $G$ and $C$ represent, respectively, the resistance, inductance, 
conductance and capacitance per unit length.

\htmladdimg{../TransmissionLine.gif}

The voltage $v(x,t)$ and current $i(x,t)$ along the transmission
line are variables of both time $t$ and 1D space $x$. Across an
infinitesimal section $\triangle x$ along the line, the voltage and 
current change from $v$ and $i$ to $v+\triangle v$ and 
$i+\triangle i$, respectively: 
\[ v+\triangle v=v-R\triangle x\; i-L\triangle x \;\frac{\partial i}{\partial t},
\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
i+\triangle i=i-G\triangle x\; v-C\triangle x\; \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} \]
We divide both sides of these equations by $\triangle x$ and let $\triangle\rightarrow 0$
to get
\[
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+L \frac{\partial i}{\partial t}+Ri=0,
\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
\frac{\partial i}{\partial x}+C \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}+Gv=0
\]
Differentiating the first equation with respect to $t$ and the second one
with respect to $x$, the two equations can be combined to get 
\[	\frac{\partial^2 i}{\partial x^2}-LC\frac{\partial^2 i}{\partial t^2}
	-RC\frac{\partial i}{\partial t}+G\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}=0
\]
Replacing $\partial v/\partial x$ by $-L \partial i/\partial t-Ri$, we get
the {\em transmission line equation} for current $i(x,t)$:
\[	\frac{\partial^2 i}{\partial x^2}=LC\frac{\partial^2 i}{\partial t^2}
	+(RC+GL)\frac{\partial i}{\partial t}+GRi
\]
Similarly, differentiating the first equation above with respect to $x$ and 
the second one with respect to $t$, the two equations can be combined 
to get the {\em transmission line equation} for voltage $v(x,t)$:
\[	\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}=LC\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial t^2}
	+(RC+GL)\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}+GRv
\]

The PDEs above can be more conveniently solved by Laplace transform (LT).
The LT of both $v(x,t)$ and $i(x,t)$ with respect to $t$ can be found as:
\[ 	V(x,s)={\cal L}[v(x,t)]=\int_0^\infty v(x,t)e^{-st}dt	\]
\[ 	I(x,s)={\cal L}[i(x,t)]=\int_0^\infty i(x,t)e^{-st}dt	\]
Based on the assumed zero initial conditions and the differential property of
the LT, we also have:
\[ {\cal L}\left[\frac{dv}{dt}\right]=sV(s),\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
{\cal L}\left[\frac{di}{dt}\right]=sI(s) \]
Now the two PDEs above become ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect 
to variable $x$ (while $s$ treated as a parameter):
\[ \frac{dV}{dx}+(sL+R)I=0,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\frac{dI}{dx}+(sC+G)V=0 \]
Combining these two equations we get
\[ \frac{d^2V}{dx^2}=(sL+R)(sC+G)V=\mu^2V,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
\frac{d^2I}{dx^2}=(sL+R)(sC+G)I=\mu^2I \]
where 
\[ \mu=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(sL+R)(sC+G)}} \]
The solution is
\[ V(x,s)=V_f(s) e^{-x/\mu}+V_b(s) e^{-x/\mu} \]
where $e^{sx/\mu}$ and $e^{-sx/\mu}$ are the two particular solutions, weighted
by two arbitrary constants $V_b(s)$ and $V_f(s)$ (not functions of $x$ but 
still functions of $s$ or $t$ in time domain treated as a parameter), which
are to be determined based on the boundary conditions as discussed later. 

Similarly, the solution for the current can be found to be
\[ I(x,s)=I_f(s) e^{-x/\mu}+I_b(s) e^{x/\mu} \]
Moreover, the relationship between the current $I(x,s)$ and voltage $V(x,s)$ 
can be found. Specifically, we first find the derivative of $V(x,s)$ with 
respect to $x$:
\[ \frac{dV(x,s)}{dx}=\frac{1}{\mu}[-V_f(s) e^{-x/\mu}+V_b(s) e^{x/\mu}] \]
and then get
\begin{eqnarray}
  I(x,s)&=&-\frac{1}{sL+R}\frac{dV}{dx}
  =\frac{1}{(sL+R)\mu}[V_f(s) e^{-x/\mu}-V_b(s) e^{-x/\mu}]
  \nonumber \\
  &=&\sqrt{\frac{sC+G}{sL+R}}\;[V_f(s) e^{-x/\mu}-V_b(s) e^{x/\mu}]
  =\frac{1}{Z_0}\;[V_f(s) e^{-x/\mu}-V_b(s) e^{-x/\mu}]
  \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
where $Z_0(s)$ is the {\em characteristic impedance} of the transmission line
defined as
\[ Z_0(s)=\sqrt{\frac{sL+R}{sC+G}} \]
Comparing the 2nd expression of $I(x,s)$ with the first one, we see that
\[ I_f(s)=\frac{V_f(s)}{Z_0(s)},\;\;\;\;\;\;\;I_b(s)=\frac{V_b(s)}{-Z_0(s)} \]

The voltage $v(x,s)$ and current $i(x,s)$ in time domain can be obtained by
taking the inverse LT of the solutions $V(x,s)$ and $I(x,s)$. To do so, we 
first assume the inverse LTs of the coefficients are
\[ v_b(t)={\cal L}^{-1}[V_b(s)],\;\;\;\;\;v_f(t)={\cal L}^{-1}[V_f(s)] \]
and
\[ i_b(t)={\cal L}^{-1}[I_b(s)]={\cal L}^{-1}[-V_b(s)/Z_0(s)],\;\;\;\;\;
i_f(t)={\cal L}^{-1}[I_f(s)]={\cal L}^{-1}[V_f(s)/Z_0(s)] \]
then we have
\[ v(x,t)={\cal L}^{-1}[V(x,s)]={\cal L}^{-1}[ V_f(s) e^{-x/\mu}+V_b(s) e^{-x/\mu} ]
=v_b(t+x/\mu)+v_f(t-x/\mu) \]
Similarly, 
\[ i(x,t)={\cal L}^{-1}[I(x,s)]={\cal L}^{-1}[ I_f(s) e^{-x/\mu}+I_b(s) e^{-x/\mu} ]
=i_b(t+x/\mu)+i_f(t-x/\mu) \]
We now see both $v(x,t)$ and $i(x,t)$ are composed of two components traveling
at speed $\mu$ in opposite directions along the transmission line. If the length 
of the transmission line is $l$, then the time for the wave to travel the whole 
length is
\[ T\stackrel{\triangle}{=}\frac{l}{\mu} =l \sqrt{(sL+R)(sC+G)} \]

\section*{Forward and backward traveling waves}


At high frequency, the inductance and capacitance are dominant and the 
resistance and conductance can be ignored, i.e., $R=G=0$. In this case the
transmission line is {\em loss-less} and the above equations become
\[
\frac{\partial^2 i}{\partial x^2}=LC \frac{\partial^2 i}{\partial t^2}=\frac{1}{\mu^2} \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial t^2}
\]
\[
\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}=LC \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial t^2}=\frac{1}{\mu^2} \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial t^2}
\]
These high frequency transmission line equations are actually {\em wave 
equations} with the {\em velocity of the waves} defined as:
\[	\mu \stackrel{\triangle}{=} \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}	\]


\[ \frac{dV}{dx}=-sLI\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\frac{dI}{dx}=-sCV	\]
Combining these two first order ODEs, we get the voltage wave equation as
a second order ODE:
\[	\frac{d^2 V}{d x^2}-s^2LCV
	=\frac{d^2 V}{d x^2}-\left(\frac{s}{\mu}\right)^2V=0	\]
where $\mu=1/\sqrt{LC}$ is the speed of the wave traveling along the line.

The general solution of the 2nd order ODE is
\[	V(x,s)=V_b(s)e^{sx/\mu}+V_f(s)e^{-sx/\mu}=V_B(x,s)+V_F(x,s)	\]
where $e^{sx/\mu}$ and $e^{-sx/\mu}$ are the two particular solutions, weighted
by two arbitrary constants $V_b(s)$ and $V_f(s)$ (not functions of $x$ but 
still functions of $s$ or $t$ in time domain treated as a parameter), which
are to be determined based on the boundary conditions as discussed later. 
In the expression above we have also defined
\[	V_B(x,s)\stackrel{\triangle}{=}V_b(s)e^{ sx/\mu} \]
\[	V_F(x,s)\stackrel{\triangle}{=}V_f(s)e^{-sx/\mu} \]
Note that $V_b(s)$ and $V_f(s)$ are just the backward and forward voltages
at the front end of the line ($x=0$):
\[	V_b(s)=V_B(0,s),\;\;\;\;\mbox{and}\;\;\;\;V_f(s)=V_F(0,s)	\]
The voltage $v(x,t)$ in time domain can be obtained by inverse Laplace 
transform of $V(x,s)$ above. To do so, we first assume
\[ v_b(t)={\cal L}^{-1}[V_b(s)],\;\;\;\;\;v_f(t)={\cal L}^{-1}[V_f(s)] \]
and then we get
\[ v(x,t)={\cal L}^{-1}[V(x,s)]={\cal L}^{-1}[V_b(s)e^{sx/\mu}]+{\cal L}^{-1}[V_f(s)e^{-sx/\mu}]
=v_b(t+x/\mu)+v_f(t-x/\mu)	\]
The solution is composed of two voltage waves $v_b(t+x/\mu)$ and $v_f(t-x/\mu)$
traveling along the transmission line in backward and forward directions, 
respectively. Similar result can be obtained for the current equation:
\[	I(x,s)=I_B(x,s)+I_F(x,s)=I_b(s)e^{sx/\mu}+I_f(s)e^{-sx/\mu} \]
or in the time domain
\[	i(x,t)=i_b(t+x/\mu)+i_f(t-x/\mu)	\]


\section*{Characteristic Impedance}

Substituting $V(x,s)=V_b(s)e^{sx/\mu}+V_f(s)e^{-sx/\mu}$ and
$I(x,s)=I_b(s)e^{sx/\mu}+I_f(s)e^{-sx/\mu}$ into the equation
\[	\frac{dV}{dx}=-sLI	\]
we have
\[	\frac{s}{\mu}[V_b(s)e^{sx/\mu}-V_f(s)e^{-sx/\mu}]
	=-sL[I_f(s)e^{sx/\mu}+I_b(s)e^{-sx/\mu}]	\]
or 
\[ \left[\frac{s}{\mu}V_b(s)+sLI_b(s)\right]e^{sx/\mu}=
	\left[\frac{s}{\mu}V_f(s)-sLI_f(s)\right]e^{-sx/\mu}	\]
For this equation to hold for any $x\ne 0$, the coefficients of the
exponentials have to be zero:
\[	\frac{s}{\mu}V_b(s)+sLI_b(s)=\frac{s}{\mu}V_f(s)-sLI_f(s)=0 \]
From these equations we can find the {\em characteristic impedance} 
of the transmission line defined as the ratio between forward voltage 
and current
\[	Z_0(s)\stackrel{\triangle}{=}\frac{V_f(s)}{I_f(s)}
	=L\mu=\frac{L}{\sqrt{LC}}=\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}	\]
and the ratio between backward voltage and current is
\[	\frac{V_b(s)}{I_b(s)}=-L\mu=-\frac{L}{\sqrt{LC}}
	=-\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}=-Z_0(s)	\]
We also have
\[	\frac{V_F(x,s)}{I_F(x,s)}
	=\frac{V_f(s)e^{-sTx/l}}{I_f(s)e^{-sTx/l}}
	=\frac{V_f(s)}{I_f(s)}=Z_0(s)	\]
\[	\frac{V_B(x,s)}{I_B(x,s)}
	=\frac{V_b(s)e^{-sTx/l}}{I_b(s)e^{-sTx/l}}
	=\frac{V_b(s)}{I_b(s)}=-Z_0(s)	\]
Note that the characteristic impedance $Z_0(s)$ is solely determined by the
distributive inductance $L$ and capacitance $C$ of the transmission
line, and it is independent of the total length $l$ of the line.

\newpage
\section*{Termination}

The transmission line is typically used to connect a voltage source
$v_0(t)$ or $V_0(s)$ with output (internal) impedance $Z_1(s)$ and a
load of input impedance $Z_2(s)$, as shown in the figure. 

\htmladdimg{../TransmissionLine1.gif}

\begin{itemize}
\item At the front of the line ($x=0$), we have
  \[	V_1(s)=V_0(s)-I_1(s)Z_1(s)	\]
  but as
  \[ V_1(s)=V(x,s)|_{x=0}=\left[V_b(s)e^{sTx/l}+V_f(s)e^{-sTx/l}\right]_{x=0}=V_b(s)+V_f(s) \]
  \[ I_1(s)=I(x,s)|_{x=0}=\left[I_b(s)e^{sTx/l}+I_f(s)e^{-sTx/l}\right]_{x=0}=I_b(s)+I_f(s) \]
  we have
  \[ V_b(s)+V_f(s)=V_0(s)-[I_b(s)+I_f(s)]Z_1(s)
  =V_0(s)-[-V_b(s)+V_f(s)]\frac{Z_1(s)}{Z_0(s)}	\]
  Solving for $V_f(s)$, we have
  \[V_f(s)=\frac{Z_0(s)}{Z_0(s)+Z_1(s)}V_0(s)+\frac{Z_1(s)-Z_0(s)}{Z_1(s)+Z_0(s)}V_b(s)
  =A(s)V_0(s)+\eta_1(s)V_b(s)	\]
  where
  \[	A(s)\stackrel{\triangle}{=}\frac{Z_0(s)}{Z_0(s)+Z_1(s)}	\]
  is the {\em voltage attenuation ratio} describing the transmission 
  line and the output impedance of the source as a voltage divider, and
  \[ \eta_1(s)\stackrel{\triangle}{=}\frac{Z_1(s)-Z_0(s)}{Z_1(s)+Z_0(s)} \]
  is the {\em reflection coefficient at the front of the line} representing 
  how much of the backward voltage wave is reflected at the front. In
  particular, we consider the following two special cases:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When the internal impedance of the source $Z_1(s)=Z_0(s)$ is equal to
    the characteristic impedance, $\eta_1(s)=0$; i.e., the backward voltage 
    is not reflected at the front end. $V_f(s)=A(s) V_0(s)$.
  \item When the internal impedance of the source $Z_1(s)=0$ is zero,
    $\eta_1(s)=-1$; i.e., the backward voltage is 100\% reflected.
    $V_f(s)=A(s)V_0(s)-V_b(s)$.
  \end{itemize}

\item At the end of the transmission line ($x=l$), we have
  \[	V_2(s)=I_2(s)Z_2(s)	\]
  But as
  \[ V_2(s)=V(x,s)|_{x=l}=[V_b(s)e^{sx/\mu}+V_f(s)e^{-sx/\mu}]_{x=l}
  =V_b(s)e^{sT}+V_f(s)e^{-sT}	\]
  \[ I_2(s)=I(x,s)|_{x=l}=[I_b(s)e^{sx/\mu}+I_f(s)e^{-sx/\mu}]_{x=l}
  =I_b(s)e^{sT}+I_f(s)e^{-sT}	\]
  we have
  \[ V_b(s)e^{sT}+V_f(s)e^{-sT}=[I_b(s)e^{sT}+I_f(s)e^{-sT}]Z_2(s)
  =[-V_b(s)e^{sT}+V_f(s)e^{-sT}]\frac{Z_2(s)}{Z_0(s)} \]
  i.e.,
  \[ V_b(s)[Z_0(s)+Z_2(s)]e^{sT} =V_f(s)[Z_2(s)-Z_0(s)]e^{-sT} \]
  From this we can define the {\em reflection coefficient at the end of the line}
  as the ratio between the backward voltage and the forward voltage at the end 
  of the line:
  \[	\eta_2(s)\stackrel{\triangle}{=}\frac{V_B(l,s)}{V_F(l,s)}
  =\frac{V_b(s)e^{sT}}{V_f(s)e^{-sT}}=\frac{Z_2(s)-Z_0(s)}{Z_2(s)+Z_0(s)}	\]
  which represents how much of the forward voltage wave is reflected at the 
  end. Now we have
  \[ V_B(l,s)=V_b(s) e^{sT}=\eta_2(s) V_F(l,s)=\eta_2(s) V_f(s) e^{-sT}  \]
  Consider these three special cases:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When the load $Z_2(s)=\infty$ is an open-circuit, $\eta_2=1$,
    $V_B(l,s)=V_F(l,s)$; i.e., the forward volate is 100\% reflected.
  \item When the load $Z_2(s)=0$ is a short-circuit, $\eta_2=-1$, 
    $V_B(l,s)=-V_F(l,s)$; i.e., the forward volate is 100\% reflected.
  \item When the load impedance $Z_2(s)=Z_0(s)$ is equal to the characteristic
    impedance, $\eta_2(s)=0$, and $V_B(l,s)=\eta_2(s) V_F(l,s)=0$; i.e.,
    the forward voltage is not reflected and the backward voltage is zero.
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
In the following we will analyze the transmission line only in s domain, all
variables (such $V(s)$, $I(s)$), all impedances (such as $Z_0(s)$, $Z_1(s)$, 
$Z_2(s)$), and all coefficients (such as $A(s)$, $\eta_1(s)$, $\eta_2(s)$) are 
functions of $s$. We will therefore drop the argument $s$.


\newpage
\section*{Determination of $V_b$ and $V_f$}

Summarizing the above, we have two simultaneous equations with 
$V_b$ and $V_f$ as two unknowns:
\[ \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
V_f=AV_0+\eta_1V_b & \mbox{(at the front $x=0$)} \\
V_)e^{sT}=\eta_2V_fe^{-sT} & \mbox{(at the end $x=l$)}
	\end{array} \right. \]
Given the voltage source $V_0$, we can solve these simultaneous
equations to get the forward and backward voltages:
\[ V_f=\frac{A}{1-\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT}}V_0 \]
\[ V_b=\frac{A\eta_2e^{-2sT}}{1-\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT}}V_0 \]
Moreover, the voltages at the two ends of the transmission line can 
be obtained. At the front, we have
\[ V_1=V_b+V_f=\frac{A(1+\eta_2e^{-2sT})}{1-\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT}}V_0 = T_1V_0 \]
where $T_1$ is the {\em voltage transfer function at the front} 
defined as
\[ T_1\stackrel{\triangle}{=}\frac{A(1+\eta_2e^{-2sT})}{1-\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT}}	\]

At the end, we have
\[  V_2=V_be^{sT}+V_fe^{-sT}=\frac{A(1+\eta_2)e^{-sT}}{1-\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT}}V_0 = T_2V_0 \]
where $T_2$ is the {\em voltage transfer function at the end} 
defined as
\[ T_2\stackrel{\triangle}{=}\frac{A(1+\eta_2)e^{-sT}}{1-\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT}}	\]

The input current is
\[  I_1(x,s) &=& I(x,s)|_{x=0}=I_b+I_f
=\frac{-V_b+V_f}{Z_0}=\frac{A(1-\eta_2e^{-2sT})}{1-\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT}}
  \frac{V_0}{Z_0}	\]
The {\em input impedance} of the transmission line can be obtained as:
\[ Z_{in}\stackrel{\triangle}{=}\frac{V_1}{I_1}=\frac{1+\eta_2e^{-2sT}}{1-\eta_2e^{-2sT}}
Z_0 \]

\section*{Physical Interpretation}

To find the physical interpretation of the voltage transfer functions
$T_1$ and $T_2$ at both ends of the line, we first consider their common
denominator. Assuming $Re[s]>0$ (and also $|\eta_1|<1$ and $|\eta_2|<1$), 
we have $|\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT}|<1$ and the common denominator can be 
expanded to become:
\[	\frac{1}{1-\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT}}=1+\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT}
	+(\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT})^2+(\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT})^3+\cdots 
\]
The voltage at front of the line is
\[ V_1=T_1V_0=AV_0(1+\eta_2e^{-s2T})[1+\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT}
	+(\eta_1\eta_2)^2e^{-4sT}+\cdots ]	\]
Here $AV_0$ is the voltage first entering the line at $t=0$, the term 
$(1+\eta_2 e^{-s2T})$ represents the sum of the forward wave and backward
wave reflected by the end of the line arriving at front after $2T$ time
delay. The general term $(\eta_1\eta_2)^ke^{-2ksT}$ ($k=1,2,3, \cdots$) 
inside the brackets represents the signal arriving at the front of the 
line after traveling forward and backward $k$ times along the line and 
being reflected $k$ times at both ends. When the impedances are not well 
matched, $Z_0\ne Z_1$, $Z_0\ne Z_2$, and therefore $\eta_1\ne 0$ and 
$\eta_2\ne 0$, there will be multiple (infinite in principle) reflections 
in the transmission line.

The output voltage at end of the line is 
\begin{eqnarray}
V_2 &=& T_2V_0=AV_0(1+\eta_2)e^{-sT}[1+\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT}
	+(\eta_1\eta_2)^2e^{-4sT}+\cdots ]
	\nonumber \\
 &=& AV_0 [ (1+\eta_2)e^{-sT}+(1+\eta_2)\eta_1\eta_2e^{-3sT}+
	(1+\eta_2)(\eta_1\eta_2)^2e^{-5sT}+ \cdots ]
	\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
Again $AV_0$ is the voltage first entering the line at $t=0$. The term 
$(1+\eta_2)$ represents the sum of the forward wave and its reflection at
the end of the line, and the factor $e^{-sT}$ represents the delay time for 
the wave to travel forward from front to end of the line. The meaning of the
general term $(\eta_1\eta_2)^ke^{-2ksT}$ is the same as above. 

\section*{Power delivery}

For simplicity, here we assume all impedances ($Z_0$, $Z_1$, and $Z_2$) 
are real, but the volages and currents are not necessarily real.

The power delivered from the source to the load is


\section*{Examples}

\begin{itemize}
\item Assume the output impedance of the voltage source, the input impedance 
  of the load and the characteristic impedance of the transmission line are 
  all the same $Z_1=Z_2=Z_0$. Then we have:

\[ A=\frac{Z_0}{Z_0+Z_1}=\frac{1}{2},\;\;\;\;\;\;
\eta_1=\frac{Z_1-Z_0}{Z_1+Z_0}
=\eta_2=\frac{Z_2-Z_0}{Z_2+Z_0}=0 \]

\[ T_1=\frac{A[1+\eta_2e^{-2sT}]}{1-\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT}}=A=\frac{1}{2}	\]

\[ T_2=\frac{A[1+\eta_2]e^{-sT}}{1-\eta_1\eta_2e^{-2sT}}=Ae^{-sT}=\frac{1}{2}e^{-sT}	\]

\[ Z_{in}=\frac{1+\eta_2e^{-2sT}}{1-\eta_2e^{-2sT}}Z_0=Z_0 \]

Under a step input 
\[	V_0=\frac{V}{s},\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
        v_0(t)=V u(t)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0 & t<0 \\ V & t \ge 0 \end{array} \right. \]
we have
\[	V_1=T_1V_0=\frac{V}{2},\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
	v_1(t)={\cal L}^{-1}[V_1]=\frac{V}{2}u(t)	\]
and
\[	V_2=T_2V_0=\frac{V}{2}e^{-sT},\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
	v_2(t)={\cal L}^{-1}[V_2]=\frac{V}{2}u(t-T)	\]
The load and the transmission line behave like a voltage divider with
a pure delay of $T$. In particular, if the internal impedance is zero
$Z_1=0$, we have $A=1$, $\eta_1=-1$, $\eta_2=0$, $T_1=1$,
$T_2=e^{-sT}$, $Z_{in}=Z_0$, and consequently, 
\[	V_1=T_1V_0=V_0,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;V_2=T_2V_0=V_0e^{-sT}	\]
i.e., the input voltage $V_0$ is transmitted to the output (the 
load) without distortion but a pure delay of $T$. 

\item Assume $Z_1=Z_0$ but the load is an open circuit, i.e., 
$Z_2\rightarrow \infty$, we have
\[	A=\frac{1}{2},\;\;\;\;\;\;\eta_1=0,\;\;\;\;\;\;\eta_2=1,
\;\;\;\;\;\;T_1=\frac{1}{2}(1+e^{-2sT}),\;\;\;\;\;\;T_2=e^{-sT}	\]
\[ Z_{in}=\frac{1+e^{-2sT}}{1-e^{-2sT}}Z_0=\frac{Z_0}{tanh(sT)} \]
In particular, if $|sT| << 1$, we have
\[ Z_{in}\approx \frac{Z_0}{sT}=\frac{\sqrt{L/C}}{sl\sqrt{LC}}
	=\frac{1}{slC}=\frac{1}{sC_{line}}	\]
i.e., if $T$ is short compared to times of interest (pulse width or
period of signal), the open circuit load behaves like a capacitor of
capacitance equal to that of the entire line $C_{line}=lC$.

Under the same step input $V_0=V/s$, or $v_0(t)=Vu(t)$, we have
\[	V_2=T_2V_0=\frac{V}{s}e^{-sT}	\]
or
\[	v_2(t)={\cal L}^{-1}[V_2]=Vu(t-T)	\]
i.e., the output is just a delayed version of the input. But at the
front
\[	V_1=T_1V_0=\frac{V}{2s}(1+e^{-2sT})	\]
or
\[	v_1(t)={\cal L}^{-1}[V_1]=\frac{V}{2}[u(t)+u(t-2T)]	\]
The second term $u(t-2T)$ is the reflection at the end of the line
with coefficient $\eta_2=1$ which arrives at the front after
the signal traveling along the line forward and backward in $2T$ time.
But as $\eta_1=0$, it is no longer reflected at the front.

\item Assume $Z_1=Z_0$ but the load is a short circuit, i.e., 
$Z_2=0$, we have
\[	A=\frac{1}{2},\;\;\;\;\;\;\eta_1=0,\eta_2=-1,\;\;\;\;\;\;
	T_1=\frac{1}{2}(1-e^{-2sT}),\;\;\;\;\;\;T_2=0	\]
\[ Z_{in}=\frac{1-e^{-2sT}}{1+e^{-2sT}}Z_0=Z_0\;tanh(sT) \]
In particular, if $|sT| << 1$, we have
\[ Z_{in}\approx Z_0 \;sT=\sqrt{L/C}sl\sqrt{LC}
	=slL=sL_{line}	\]
i.e., if $T$ is short compared to times of interest, the short
circuit load behaves like an inductor of inductance equal to that of 
the entire line $L_{line}=lL$.

Under the same step input $V_0=V/s$, or $v_0(t)=Vu(t)$, we have
\[	V_2=T_2V_0=0	\]
i.e., the output is zero due to the short circuit load. But at the
front
\[	V_1=T_1V_0=\frac{V}{2s}(1-e^{-2sT})	\]
or
\[	v_1(t)={\cal L}^{-1}[V_1]=\frac{V}{2}[u(t)-u(t-2T)]	\]
The second term $-u(t-2T)$ is the reflection at the end of the line
with coefficient $\eta_2=-1$ which arrives at the front after
the signal traveling along the line forward and backward in $2T$ time.
As the reflected signal $-u(t-2T)$ cancels the input $u(t)$ after $2T$
time, the step input becomes a pulse of width $2T$ at the front of
the line.

\item Assume $Z_1=Z_0$ but the load is a pure inductance, i.e.,
$Z_2=sL_2$, we have
\[	A=\frac{1}{2},\;\;\;\;\;\;\eta_1=0,\;\;\;\;\;\;
\eta_2=\frac{sL_2-Z_0}{sL_2+Z_0}=\frac{s-1/\tau}{s+1/\tau} \]
where $\tau\stackrel{\triangle}{=}sL_2/Z_0$ is the time constant of the
circuit. 
\[	T_1=\frac{1}{2}\left[1+\frac{s-1/\tau}{s+1/\tau} e^{-2sT}\right],
\;\;\;\;\;\;T_2=\frac{s}{s+1/\tau}e^{-sT} \]

The response at the front of the line to a step input 
$v_0(t)=Vu(t)$ or $V_0=V/s$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
V_1 & = & T_1V_0
	=\frac{1}{2}\left[1+\frac{s-1/\tau}{s+1/\tau}e^{-2sT}\right]\frac{V}{s}
	\nonumber \\
 & = & \frac{V}{2s}\left[1+\left(\frac{2s}{s+1/\tau}-1\right)e^{-2sT}\right]
  =\frac{V}{2s}\left(1-e^{-2sT}\right)+\frac{V}{s+1/\tau}e^{-2sT}
	\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
or in time domain
\[	v_1(t)={\cal L}^{-1}[V_1]=\frac{V}{2}[u(t)-u(t-2T)]+Ve^{-(t-2T)/\tau}u(t-2T) \]
The response at the end of the line is
\[ 	V_2=T_2V_0=\frac{s}{s+\tau}e^{-sT} \frac{V}{s}
	=\frac{V}{s+\tau}e^{-sT} \]
or in time domain
\[	v_2(t)={\cal L}^{-1}[V_2]=Ve^{-(t-T)/\tau}u(t-T)	\]
We see that this is a {\em delayed differentiator} with delay time $T$. 

%The input impedance is
% \[ Z_{in}=\frac{sL_2(1+e^{-2sT})+Z_0(1-e^{-2sT})}
%	{sL_2(1-e^{-2sT})+Z_0(1+e^{-2sT})}Z_0	\]

\item So far we have only considered some special cases where either
$\eta_1=0$ or $\eta_2=0$ (reflection at either or both ends is
zero). As the result, the denominator of $T_1$ and $T_2$ is always 1.
Now we consider the general case where $\eta_1\ne 0$ and $\eta_2 
\ne 0$. Assume $Z_1=Z_0/2$ and $Z_2=2Z_0$, and an impulse input
\[	v_0(t)=u(t)-u(t-T/3)	\]
then we have
\[ A=\frac{Z_0}{Z_1+Z_0}=\frac{2Z_1}{Z_1+2Z_1}=\frac{2}{3} \]
\[ \eta_1=\frac{Z_1-Z_0}{Z_1+Z_0}=\frac{Z_1-2Z_1}{Z_1+2Z_1}=-\frac{1}{3} \]
\[ \eta_2=\frac{Z_2-Z_0}{Z_2+Z_0}=\frac{2Z_0-Z_0}{2Z_0+Z_0}=\frac{1}{3}  \]
The output 
\[	V_2=V_0A(1+\eta_2)e^{-sT}[1+\eta_1\eta_2 e^{-2sT}
	+(\eta_1\eta_2)^2 e^{-4sT}+\cdots ]	\]
where
\[	1+\eta_2=1+\frac{1}{3}=\frac{4}{3}	\]
\[ 	\eta_1 \eta_2=-\frac{1}{9}	\]
\begin{itemize}
\item $t=T:$ 
\[	v_2=\frac{4}{3}Av_0=\frac{8}{9}v_0	\]
\item $t=3T:$ 
\[ v_2=\frac{4}{3}A\left(-\frac{1}{9}\right)v_0=-\frac{4}{27}Av_0=-\frac{8}{81}v_0 \]
\item $t=5T:$ 
\[ v_2=\frac{4}{3}A\left(\frac{1}{81}\right)v_0=\frac{4}{243}Av_0=\frac{8}{729}v_0	\]
\item
\[	\cdots  \cdots  \cdots  \cdots  \]
\end{itemize}
Note that as the signal only has a finite $T/3$ duration, at any time $t=2kT$
only the term $(\eta_1\eta_2)^k e^{-2ksT}$ representing the wave arriving at
the end most recently is non-zero.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Attenuation}

The above LC model of the transmission line above is based on the 
assumption that the line is loss-less, i.e., $R=G=0$. In reality the 
signal is always attenuated due to the resistance $R$ in series with 
the inductance $L$ and the conductance $G$ in parallel with the 
capacitance $C$.($G=1/R_l$, where $R_l$ is the leakage resistance of
the capacitor.) The two partial differential equations describing the
line become
\[
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+L \frac{\partial i}{\partial t}+Ri=0
\]
\[
\frac{\partial i}{\partial x}+C \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}+Gv=0
\]
In Laplace domain, these equations are
\[
\frac{dV(x,s)}{dx}=-(R+sL)I(x,s)=-sL'I(x,s)
\]
\[
\frac{dI(x,s)}{dx}=-(G+sC)V(x,s)=-sC'V(x,s)
\]
where
\[	L'\stackrel{\triangle}{=}L\left(1+\frac{R}{sL}\right)	\]
\[	C'\stackrel{\triangle}{=}C\left(1+\frac{G}{sC}\right)	\]
Based on these definitions, the above equations take the same form
as that of the loss-less model (with $L$ and $C$ replaced by $L'$ and
$C'$ respectively) and can be solved in the same way. Specifically,
we have
\[
T=l\sqrt{L'C'}=l\sqrt{LC}\sqrt{\left(1+\frac{R}{sL}\right)\left(1+\frac{G}{sC}\right)}
\]
and
\[ Z_0=\sqrt{\frac{L'}{C'}}=\sqrt{\frac{L(1+R/sL)}{C(1+G/sC)}}
\]
If $R<<sL$, $G<<sC$, we have
\[ T\approx l\sqrt{LC}[1+\left(\frac{R}{L}+\frac{G}{C}\right)\frac{1}{2s}]	\]
As before, the solution of the above equations is
\[	V(x,s)=V_be^{sxT/l}+V_fe^{-sxT/l}
	\approx V_be^{\alpha x}e^{s\sqrt{LC}x}
	+V_fe^{-\alpha x}e^{-s\sqrt{LC}x}
\]
where $\alpha$ is the {\em attenuation constant} defined as:
\[
\alpha\stackrel{\triangle}{=}\frac{R}{2}\sqrt{\frac{C}{L}}+
	\frac{G}{2}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}
\]
Note that the forward wave $V_f$ attenuates exponentially as
$x$ increases from 0 to $l$, while the backward wave $V_b$
attenuates exponentially as $x$ decreases from $l$ to 0.

The inductance and capacitance 
associated with an infinitesimal section $dx$ of the transmission 
line are $Ldx$ and $Cdx$, respectively, i.e., the total inductance
and capacitance of the line are
\[	L_{line}=\int_l Ldx=lL	\]
and
\[	C_{line}=\int_l Cdx=lC	\]
