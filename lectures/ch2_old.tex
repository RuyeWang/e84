\section*{Chapter 2: Circuit Principles}

\subsection*{Solving Circuits with Kirchoff Laws}

{\bf Example 1:} Find the three unknown currents ($I_1,I_2,I_3$) and three 
	unknown voltages ($V_{ab}, V_{bd}, V_{cb}$) in the circuit below:

\htmladdimg{../figures/branchcurrentmethod.gif}

{\bf Note:} The direction of a current and the polarity of a voltage source 
can be assumed arbitrarily. To determine the actual direction and polarity, 
the sign of the values also should be considered. For example, a current 
labeled in left-to-right direction with a negative value is actually flowing 
right-to-left.

All voltages and currents in the circuit can be found by either of the 
following two methods, based on either the KVL or KCL.

\begin{itemize}
\begin{comment}
\item {\bf The Branch-Current Method:} 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Step 1:} Label each unknown branch current arbitrarily with a 
    reference direction. If the calculated value is negative, the actual
    direction of the current is opposite to the reference direction.
  \item {\bf Step 2:} Define unknown voltages in terms of the assumed currents
    to obtain three {\em element equations}:
    \[ \begin{array}{l}
	V_{ab}=2I_1,\;\;\mbox{or}\;\;\;V_{ba}=-2I_1 \\
	V_{bd}=8I_3,\;\;\mbox{or}\;\;\;V_{db}=-8I_3 \\
	V_{cb}=4I_2,\;\;\mbox{or}\;\;\;V_{bc}=-4I_2 \end{array} \]
  \item {\bf Step 3:} Apply KCL to node b:
    \[ \sum I_b=0=+I_1+I_2-I_3\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(1)		\]
    We could also apply KCL to node d:
    \[ \sum I_d=0=-I_1-I_2+I_3	\]
    but this equation is not independent as it adds no information.
  \item {\bf Step 4:} Apply KVL to loops abda and bcdb:	
    \[ \begin{array}{r} 
	\sum V_{abda}=0=V_{ab}+V_{bd}+V_{da}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(2)	\\
	\sum V_{bcdb}=0=V_{cb}+V_{bd}+V_{dc}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(3)	
    \end{array} \]
    We could also apply KVL to loop abcda:
    \[ \sum V_{abcda}=0=V_{ab}+V_{bc}+V_{cd}+V_{da}	\]
    But this equation is not independent as it can be obtained as the
    difference between the previous two equations. 
    The above three independent equations (one for current, two for
    voltage) are called {\em connection equations}.
  \item {\bf Step 5:} We now have three simultaneous equations with three 
    unknown branch currents:
    \[ \begin{array}{r}
        \sum I_b=0=+I_1+I_2-I_3\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(1)	\\
	\sum V_{abda}=0=V_{ab}+V_{bd}+V_{da}=2I_1+8I_3-32\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(2') \\
	\sum V_{bcdb}=0=V_{cb}+V_{bd}+V_{dc}=4I_2+8I_3-20\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(3')
	\end{array} \]
    which can be rewritten as
    \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{rrrrr}
	  I_1 & +I_2 & -I_3& = &  0\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(1) \\
	 2I_1 &    & +8I_3 & = & 32\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(2') \\
	      &4I_2& +8I_3 & = & 20\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(3') \end{array} \right. \]
  \item {\bf Step 6: } Solving the equations, we get the three unknown currents:
    \[ I_1=4,\;\;\;I_2=-1,\;\;\;I_3=3	\]
    and then we get the three unknown voltages:
    \[ V_{ab}=8,\;\;\;V_{bd}=24,\;\;\;V_{cb}=-4	\]
  \end{itemize}

  Note that equations from KCL at node d and KVL to other loops are not
  independent. In general, if a circuit has n nodes and b branches, then
  there are $(n-1)$ independent node equations and $l=b-(n-1)$ independent 
  loop equations. In other words, the sum of the number of independent loops
  and the number of independent nodes is always the same as the number of 
  branches, i.e., the number of equations is always equal to the number of 
  unknowns in the branch current method.
\end{comment}

\item {\bf The loop-current method based on KVL:}
  \begin{enumerate} 
  \item For each of the $l$ independent loops in the circuit, define a 
    loop current around the loop in clockwise (or counter clockwise)
    direction. These $l$ loop currents are the unknown variables to
    be obtained.
  \item Apply KVL around each of the loops in the same clockwise 
    direction to obtain $l$ equations. While calculating the voltage 
    drop across each resistor shared by two loops, both loop currents 
    (in opposite positions) should be considered.
  \item Solve the equation system with $l$ equations for the $l$ unknown
    loop currents.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \htmladdimg{../figures/loopcurrentmethod.gif}

  Find currents $I_1$ from a to b, $I_2$ from c to b, and $I_3$ from 
  b to d.

  \begin{itemize}

  \item Assume two loop currents $I_a$ and $I_b$ around loops abda and bcdb 
    and apply the KVL to them:
    \begin{eqnarray} 
      \sum V_{abda}&=&-32+2I_a+8(I_a-I_b)=0\nonumber\\
      \sum V_{bcdb}&=&8(I_b-I_a)+4I_b+20=0\nonumber
    \end{eqnarray}
    We rewrite these as:
    \[
    \left\{ \begin{array}{rrrr} 10I_a&-8I_b&=&32 \\ -8I_a &+12I_b&=&-20
    \end{array} \right. 
    \begin{comment}
    \;\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;\;
    \left\{ \begin{array}{rrrr} 5I_a&-4I_b&=&16 \\ -2I_a &+3I_b&=&-5\end{array} \right. 
    \end{comment}
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\Longrightarrow \;\;\;\;\;
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
      I_a=4 \\  I_b=1 \end{array} \right. 
    \]
    and then get $I_1=I_a=4$, $I_2=-I_b=-1$, and $I_3=I_a-I_b=3$. Having 
    found $I_a$ and $I_b$, we can easily find all voltages in the circuit:
    $V_a=32V$, $V_b=32-2\times 4=24V$, $V_c=20V$.
    
  \item We could also apply KVL around the third loop of abcda with a loop
    current $I_c$ to get
    three equations:
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \sum V_{abda}&=&-32+2(I_a+I_c)+8(I_a-I_b)=0\nonumber \\
      \sum V_{bcdb}&=&8(I_b-I_a)+4(I_b+I_c)+20=0\nonumber \\
      \sum V_{abcda}&=&-32+2(I_a+I_c)+4(I_b+I_c)+20=0\nonumber
    \end{eqnarray}
    However, it is clear that the third equation is the sum of the
    first two, i.e., it is not independent.

  \item Alternatively, consider the two loop currents $I_a$ and $I_c$ 
    around loops abda and bcdb:
    \begin{eqnarray}
      \sum V_{abda}&=&-32+2(I_a+I_c)+8I_a=0\nonumber\\
      \sum V_{abcda}&=&-32+2(I_a+I_c)+4I_c+20=0\nonumber
    \end{eqnarray}
    i.e.,
    \[
    \left\{ \begin{array}{rrrr} 10I_a&+2I_c&=&32 \\ 2I_a &+6I_c&=&12
    \end{array} \right. 
    \begin{comment}
    \;\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.,}\;\;\;\;\;\;
    \left\{ \begin{array}{rrrr} 5I_a&+I_c&=&16 \\ I_a &+3I_c&=&6\end{array} \right. 
    \end{comment}
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\Longrightarrow \;\;\;\;\;
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
      I_a=3 \\  I_c=1 \end{array} \right. 
    \]
    and we get $I_1=I_a+I_c=4$ and $I_2=-I_c=-1$, same as the previous 
    results.

  \end{itemize}

\item {\bf The node-voltage method based on KCL:}

  \begin{enumerate} 
  \item Assume there are $n$ nodes in the circuit. Select one of them as
    the ground, the reference point for all voltages of the circuit.
    The voltage at each of the remaining $n-1$ nodes is an unknown to be 
    obtained.
  \item Apply KCL to each of the $n-1$ nodes to obtain $n-1$ equations. 
  \item Solve the equation system with $n-1$ equations for the $n-1$
    unknown node voltages.
  \end{enumerate}

  \htmladdimg{../figures/nodevoltagemethod.png}

  In the same circuit considered previously, there are only 2 nodes $b$ and
  $d$ (note $a$ and $c$ are not nodes). We assume node $d$ is the ground,
  and consider just voltage $V_b=V_{bd}$ at node $v$ as the only unknown in 
  the problem. Apply KCL to node $b$, we have
  \[
  \sum_i I_i=0=I_1+I_2+I_3	
  \]
  where
  \[
  I_1=\frac{V_a-V_b}{R_{ab}}=\frac{32-V_b}{2},\;\;\;\;
  I_2=\frac{V_c-V_b}{R_{cb}}=\frac{20-V_b}{4},\;\;\;\;
  I_3=\frac{V_d-V_b}{R_{bd}}=\frac{0-V_b}{8}  
  \]
  Substituting $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$ into the equation, we get 
  \[
  I_1+I_2+I_3=\frac{32-V_b}{2}+\frac{20-V_b}{4}+\frac{0-V_b}{8}=0
  \]
  Solving this we get $V_b=24$, and all other currents and voltages can 
  be found subsequently: $I_1=(V_a-V_b)/2=(32-24)/2=4A$, 
  $I_2=(V_c-V_b)/4=(20-24)/4=-1A$, $I_3=I_1+I_2=3A$.

  We could also apply KCL to node d, but the resulting equation is exactly
  the same as $\sum_i I_i=0=-I_1-I_2-I_3$ simply because this node d is not 
  independent.

  As special case of the node-voltage method with only two nodes, we have the
  following theorem:


\item {\bf Millman's theorem} 

  If there are multiple parallel branches between two nodes $a$ and $b$, 
  such as the circuit below (left), then the voltage $V$ at node $a$ can 
  be found as shown below if the other node $b$ is treated as the reference 
  point.

  Assume there are three types of branches:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item voltage branches with $V_i$ sources in series with $R_i$. The
    polarity of each $V_i$ is + on the node a side.
  \item current branches with $I_j$ (independent of resistors in series).
    The direction of each $I_j$ is toward node a.
  \item resistor branches with $R_k$.
  \end{itemize}

  Applying KCL to node $a$, we have:
  \[ 
  \sum_i \frac{V-V_i}{R_i}+\sum_k \frac{V}{R_k}=\sum_j I_j
  \]
  Solving for $V$, we get
  \[ 
  V=\frac{\sum_i V_i/R_i+\sum_j I_j}{\sum_i 1/R_i+\sum_k 1/R_k}=\frac{\sum I}{\sum G} 
  \]
  where the reciprocal of the resistance $G=1/R$ is the conductance.

  \htmladdimg{../figures/millmanthm.gif}
  \htmladdimg{../figures/millmanthm2.png}

  The dual form of the Millman's theorem can be derived based on the
  loop circuit on the right. Applying KVL to the loop, we have:
  \[ 
  \sum_j (I-I_j)R_j+\sum_k I R_k=\sum_i V_i
  \]
  Solving for $I$, we get
  \[ 
  I=\frac{\sum_i V_i+\sum_j R_jI_j}{\sum_i R_j+\sum_k R_k}=\frac{\sum V}{\sum R} 
  \]

\end{itemize}


{\bf Example 2:} Solve the following circuit:

\htmladdimg{../figures/branchmethod.gif}

\begin{itemize}
\begin{comment}
\item {\bf Branch current method:}

  There are $n=4$ nodes (a,b,c,d) and $b=6$ branches in the circuit, 
  therefore we can get $n-1=4-1=3$ independent node equations (first
  three) and $b-(n-1)=6-3=3$ independent loop equations (second three):
  \[ \begin{array}{l}
    \mbox{node a:}\;\;\;\;\; I_1+I_2-I_3=0 	\\
    \mbox{node b:}\;\;\;\;\;-I_1-I_4-I_6=0 	\\
    \mbox{node d:}\;\;\;\;\;-I_2+I_5+I_6=0 	\\
    \mbox{loop 1:}\;\;\;\;\;-V_{s1}+I_1R_1+I_3R_3-I_4R_4+V_{s4}=0 \\
    \mbox{loop 2:}\;\;\;\;\;-I_2R_2+V_{s2}-I_5R_5-I_3R_3=0	 \\
    \mbox{loop 3:}\;\;\;\;\;-V_{s4}+I_4R_4+I_5R_5-I_6R_6-V_{s6}=0 
  \end{array} \]
  Solving these 6 equations we get the 6 branch currents.
\end{comment}

\item {\bf Loop current method:}
  Let the three loop currents in the example above be $I_a$, $I_b$ and $I_c$ 
  for loops 1 (top-left bacb), 2 (top-right adca), and 3 (bottom bcdb),
  respectively, and applying KVL to the three loops, we get
  \[ 
  \begin{array}{l}
    \mbox{loop bacb:}\;\;\;\;\;-V_{s1}+R_1I_a+R_3(I_a-I_b)+R_4(I_a-I_c)+V_{s4}=0 \\
    \mbox{loop adca:}\;\;\;\;\;R_2I_b+V_{s2}+R_5(I_b-I_c)+R_3(I_b-I_a)=0 \\
    \mbox{loop bcdb:}\;\;\;\;\;-V_{s4}+R_4(I_c-I_a)+R_5(I_c-I_b)+R_6I_c-V_{s6}=0 
  \end{array} 
  \]
  We can then solve these 3 loop equations to find the 3 loop currents.

\item {\bf Node voltage method:}
  If node d is chosen as ground, we can apply KCL to the remaining 3 nodes 
  at a, b, and c, and get (assuming all currents leave each node):
  \[ 
  \begin{array}{l}
    \mbox{node a:}\;\;\;\;\;(V_a-(V_b+V_{s1}))/R_1+(V_a-V_{s2})/R_2+(V_a-V_c)/R_3=0 \\
    \mbox{node b:}\;\;\;\;\;(V_b-(V_a-V_{s1}))/R_1+(V_b+V_{s4}-V_c)/R_4+(V_b-V_{s6})/R_6=0 \\
    \mbox{node c:}\;\;\;\;\;(V_c-(V_b+V_{s4}))/R_4+(V_c-V_a)/R_3+V_c/R_5=0 
  \end{array} 
  \]
  We can then solve these 3 node equations to find the 3 node voltages.

\end{itemize}
We see that either of the loop-current and node-voltage methods requires 
to solve a linear system of 3 equations with 3 unknowns. 

{\bf Example 3:} Solve the following circuit with $I=0.5 A$, $V=6 V$, 
$R_1=3\Omega$, $R_2=8\Omega$, $R_3=6\Omega$, $R_4=4\Omega$. This circuit
has 3 independent loops and 3 independent nodes.

\htmladdimg{../figures/currentmethod2.png}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Loop current method:}

  Assume three loop currents $I_1$ (left), $I_2$ (right), $I_3$ (top) all 
  in clock-wise direction. We take advantage of the fact that the current 
  source is in loop 1 only, with loop current $I_1=I=0.5A$, and get the 
  following two (instead of three) loop equations with 2 unknown loop 
  currents $I_2$ and $I_3$:
  \[ 
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l} R_2(I_2-I_1)+R_3(I_2-I_3)-V=0 \\
    R_1(I_3-I_1)+R_4I_3+R_3(I_3-I_2)=0 \end{array} \right. 
  \]
  i.e.,
  \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    14 I_2-6 I_3=10 \\   -6 I_2+13 I_3=1.5 \end{array} \right. 
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\Longrightarrow \;\;\;\;\;
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    I_2=0.952 \\  I_3=0.555 \end{array} \right. 
  \]
  We can also get the three node voltages with respect to the bottom 
  node treated as ground: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Right node: $V_3=-6V$ 
    \item Middle node: $V_2=R_2(I_1-I_2)=8(0.5-0.952)=-3.616V$ 
    \item Left node: $V_1=V_3+R_4 I_3=-3.78 V$ 
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{comment}
  Alternatively, let $I_1=I$ be the loop current from the current source
  around $R_4$, $R_3$, $R_2$, $I_2$ be the loop current around $R_2$, $R_1$,
  $R_4$ and the voltage source, and $I_3$ be the loop current around $R_2$,
  $R_3$ and the voltage source, then we have the following equations:
  \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l} (I_2+I_3-I)R_2+I_2R_1+(I_2+I)R_4=V\\
    (I_2+I_3-I_1)R_2+(I_3-I)R_3=V\end{array}\right.
  \]
  i.e.,
  \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l} 7I_2-6I_3=-5\\
    8I_2+14I_3=13 \end{array}\right.
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\Longrightarrow \;\;\;\;\;
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    I_2=0.055 \\  I_3=0.897 \end{array} \right.   
  \]
  We can also get the three node voltages with respect to the bottom 
  node treated as ground: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Right node: $V_3=-6V$ 
    \item Middle node: $V_2=-R_2(I_2+I_3-I)=-8(0.055+0.897-0.5)=-3.616V$
    \item Left node: $V_1=V_3-R_4 (I+I_2)=6-4(0.5+0.055)=-3.78V$
  \end{itemize}  
  same as before.
  \end{comment}

\item {\bf Node voltage method:}

  Assume the three node voltages with respect to the bottom node treated
  as ground to be $V_1$ (left), $V_2$ (middle), $V_3$ (right). We take 
  advantage of the fact that one side of the voltage source is treated 
  as ground, and get the note voltage $V_3=-V=-6V$. Then we have only two 
  (instead of three) node equations with 2 unknown node voltages $V_1$ and 
  $V_2$: 
  \[ 
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    (V_1-V_3)/R_4+(V_1-V_2)/R_1=I \\
    (V_2-V_1)/R_1+(V_2-V_3)/R_3+V_2/R_2=0 \end{array} \right. 
  \]
  i.e.,
  \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    7V_1-4V_2=-12 \\
    -8V_1+15V_2=-24 \end{array} \right. 
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\Longrightarrow \;\;\;\;\;
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    V_1=-3.78 \\ V_2=-3.616 \end{array} \right. 
  \]
  The voltages are the same as before.
\end{itemize}
In summary, here we have taken advantage of either the given current 
source by the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item let a given current source be in a loop not shared with any 
  other loop, so that the loop current is known;
\item let one of the two ends of a given voltage source be the 
  ground, so that the voltage at the other end is known.
\end{itemize}
By either of these methods, the number of unknown loop currents or 
node voltages is reduced by one.

{\bf Example 4:} (Homework) Find all node voltages with respect to the 
top-left corner treated as reference node:

\htmladdimg{../figures/currentmethod1.gif}

$V_1=12 V$, $V_2=6 V$, $R_1=3 \Omega$, $R_2=8 \Omega$, $R_3=6 \Omega$, 
$R_4=4\Omega$.

\htmladdnormallink{Answer}{../ch2_sub0/index.html}

{\bf Note:} While using node voltage and loop current methods to solve 
a given circuit, to simplify the analysis, it is preferable to
\begin{itemize}
  \item choose independent loops to avoid current source shared by two 
    or more loops,
  \item choose ground node so that the voltage source is connected to 
    ground.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Example 5:} The two circuits shown below are equivalent, but you 
may want to choose wisely in terms of which is easier to analyze. Solve 
this circuit using both node voltage and loop current methods. Assume 
$R_1=100\Omega$, $R_2=5\Omega$, $R_3=200\Omega$, $R_4=50\Omega$, $V=50V$,
and $I=0.2A$.

\subsection*{Network Theorems}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Superposition Theorem:}

A generic system with input (stimulus, cause) $x$ and output (response,
effect) $y$ can be described mathematically as a function $y=F(x)$. 
The function is {\em linear} if it satisfies the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Homogeneity}
  \[
  F(ax)=aF(x) 
  \]
\item {\bf Superposition}
  \[ 
  F(x_1+x_2)=F(x_1)+F(x_2)	
  \]
\end{itemize}
Combining these two aspects, we have
\[
F(ax_1+bx_2)=aF(x_1)+bF(x_2)	
\]
The interpretation is that when the response is directly proportional to 
the cause in a system $F$, we can consider several causes (e.g., $x_1$ 
and $x_2$) individually and then combine the individual responses ($F(x_1)$ 
and $F(x_2)$). An electrical system of linear components (with linear 
voltage-current relation) is a linear system (if only voltage and current 
are of interest). When the circuit is linear, the following applies:

{\bf Superposition Principle:}

{\bf When there exist multiple energy sources in the circuit, any voltage 
  and current in the circuit can be found as the algebraic sum of the 
  corresponding values obtained by assuming only one source at a time,
  with all other sources turned off:}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf A voltage source is turned off if treated as short-circuit so that 
  the voltage across it is zero.}
\item {\bf A current source is turned off if treated as open-circuit so that 
  the current through it is zero.}
\end{itemize}

As superposition principle only applies to linear functions, it cannot be
applied to nonlinear functions such as power (e.g., $V^2/R$ or $I^2R$). 

\htmladdimg{../figures/superposition0.gif}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Superposition of voltage sources:}
  \[	I_{12}=\frac{aV_1+bV_2}{R}=a\frac{V_1}{R}+b\frac{V_2}{R}=aI_1+bI_2 \]
  where $I_1=V_1/R$ ($V_2$ short-circuit) and $I_2=V_2/R$ ($V_1$ short-circuit).

\item {\bf Superposition of current sources:}
  \[	V=R(aI_1+bI_2)=aI_1R+bI_2R=aV_1+bV_2 \]
  where $V_1=I_1R$ ($I_2$ open circuit) and $V_2=I_2R$ ($I_1$ open circuit).
\end{itemize}

However, note that superposition principle does not apply to any variable
nonlinearly related to the energy sources, such as power:
\[
P_{12}=\frac{(V_1+V_2)^2}{R}\ne\frac{V_1^2}{R}+\frac{V_2^2}{R}=P_1+P_2,
\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
P_{12}=R(I_1+I_2)^2 \ne RI_1^2+RI_2^2=P_1+P_2	
\]

{\bf Example 1:} The previous example can also be solved by superposition 
theorem. 

\htmladdimg{../figures/kirchhoffexample1.gif}

First, we turn the voltage source of 20V off (short-circuit with 0V), and get
\[ 
I'_1=\frac{32}{2+8 || 4}=\frac{48}{7},\;\;\;I'_2=-I'_1\frac{8}{8+4}=-\frac{32}{7},
\;\;\;I'_3=I'_1\frac{4}{8+4}=\frac{16}{7} 
\]
Second, we turn the voltage source of 32V off and get
\[
I''_2=\frac{20}{4+8 || 2}=\frac{25}{7},\;\;\;I''_1=-I''_2\frac{8}{2+8}=-\frac{20}{7},
\;\;\;I''_3=I''_2\frac{2}{8+2}=\frac{5}{7} 
\]
The overall currents can then be found as the algebraic sums of the
corresponding values obtained with one voltage source turned on at a time:
\[ 
I_1=I'_1+I''_1=\frac{48}{7}-\frac{20}{7}=4,\;\;\;\;
I_2=I''_2+I'_2=\frac{25}{7}-\frac{32}{7}=-1,\;\;\;\;
I_3=I'_3+I''_3=\frac{16}{7}+\frac{5}{7}=3 
\]

{\bf Thevenin's theorem and Norton's theorem}

In principle, all currents and voltages of an arbitrary network of linear 
components and voltage/current sources can be found by either the loop 
current method or the node voltage method, as we have seen previously.

However, if only the current $I$ and voltage $V$ associated with one 
particular component such as a resistor $R$ are of interest, it is 
unnecessary to find voltages and currents elsewhere in the circuit. 
Instead, we can ``pull'' the component out and treat it as the load 
$R_L$ of the rest of the circuit, which can be modeled as either a 
Thevenin voltage source \htmladdnormallink{(Leon Charles Thevenin)}
{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Charles_Thevenin}, a non-ideal 
voltage source $(V_T, R_T)$, or a Norton current source
\htmladdnormallink{(Edward Lawry Norton)}
{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Lawry_Norton} a non-ideal 
current source $(I_N, R_N)$. We can then find the $V$ and $I$ 
associated with the resistor $R$.

\item {\bf Thevenin's Theorem:}

    Any one-port (two-terminal) network of resistance elements and energy 
    sources is equivalent to an ideal voltage source $V_T$ in series with a 
    resistor $R_T$, where}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $V_T=V_{oc}$ is the open-circuit voltage of the network,
  \item $R_T$ is the equivalent resistance when all energy sources are 
    turned off (short-circuit for voltage sources, open-circuit for current 
    sources).
  \end{itemize}

  {\bf Proof:} 

  \htmladdimg{../figures/ProveThevenin.png}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    
  \item Assume the voltage and current associated with the load $R_L$ at
    the output port of the network are $V$ and $I$, respectively. 
    
  \item Replace the load $R_L$ by an ideal current source $I=V/R_L$ while 
    keeping voltage $V$ the same (b), all voltages and currents in the 
    network to be modeled are not affected. 
	
  \item Find voltage $V$ in terms of the internal energy sources inside
    the network and the external current source by superposition principle:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Turn the external current source off (open-circuit), the terminal
      voltage is the open-circuit voltage $V'=V_{oc}$ due only to the energy
      sources internal to the network (c).
    \item Turn all internal sources off (short-circuit for voltage sources,
      open-circuit for current sources), the terminal voltage is $V''=-R_0I$,
      where $R_0$ is the equivalent resistance of the network with all energy 
      sources off, due only to the external current source (d).
    \item By the superposition principle, we get the load voltage 
      $V=V'+V''=V_{oc}-R_0I$. This equation also describes how the load
      voltage $V$ and current $I$ are related for Thevenin's model 
      consisting a voltage source $V_T=V_{oc}$ in series with $R_T=R_0$,
      i.e., the network is equivalent to Thevenin's model.
    \end{itemize}
  
  \end{itemize}

  We see that as far as the port voltage $V$ and current $I$ associated 
  with the load are concerned, the one-port network is equivalent to an 
  ideal voltage source $V_T=V_{oc}$, the open-circuit voltage across the 
  port, in series with an internal resistance $R_T=R_0$, which can be 
  obtained as the ratio of the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit 
  current.

\item {\bf Norton's Theorem:}

  Any one-port (two-terminal) network of resistance elements and energy 
  sources is equivalent to an ideal current source $I_N$ in parallel with a 
  resistor $R_N$, where
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $I_N=I_{sc}$ is the short-circuit current of the network
  \item $R_N=R_T$ is the same resistance as in Thevenin's theorem
  \end{itemize}

  {\bf Proof:} The proof of this theorem is in parallel with the proof of 
  Thevenin's theorem. 

  \htmladdimg{../figures/ProveNorton.png}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Assume the voltage and current associated with the load $R_L$ at
    the output port of the network are $V$ and $I$, respectively. 

  \item Replace the load $R_L$ by an ideal voltage source $V=IR_L$ while 
    keeping current $I$ the same (b), all voltages and currents in the 
    network to be modeled are not affected. 
	
  \item Find current $I$ in terms of the internal energy sources inside
    the network and the external voltage source by superposition principle:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Turn the external voltage source off (short-circuit), the terminal
      current is the short-circuit current $I'=I_{sc}$ due only to the energy
      sources internal to the network (c).
    \item Turn all internal sources off (short-circuit for voltage sources, 
      open-circuit for current sources), the terminal current is $I''=-V/R_0$,
      where $R_0$ is the equivalent resistance of the network with all energy
      sources off, due only to the external voltage source (d).
    \item By the superposition principle, we get the load current  
      $I=I'+I''=I_{sc}-V/R_0$. As this equation also describes how the 
      load voltage $V$ and current $I$ are related for the Norton's model 
      consisting a current source $I_N=I_{sc}$ in parallel with $R_N=R_0$,
      i.e., the network is equivalent to Norton's model.
    \end{itemize}

  \end{itemize}

  We see that as far as the port voltage $V$ and current $I$ associated 
  with the load are concerned, the one-port network is equivalent to an 
  ideal current source $I_N=I_{sc}$, the short-circuit current through the 
  port, in parallel with an internal resistance $R_N=R_0$, which can be 
  obtained as the ratio of the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit 
  current.

  Moreover, we note that Thevenin's theorem and Norton's theorem are 
  equivalent, as one can always be converted into the other. The internal 
  resistances in both theorems are the same $R_T=R_N$, and the voltage 
  source $V_T=V_{oc}$ in series with $R_T$ in Thevenin's theorem can be 
  converted to a current source $V_{oc}/R_T=V_T/R_T=I_{sc}=I_N$ in parallel 
  with $R_N=R_T$ in Norton's theorem. In either case, we can find the 
  internal resistance by
  \[
  R_T=R_N=\frac{V_{oc}}{I_{sc}}
  \]

{\bf Load Line and Output Resistance}

Due to Thevenin's and Norton's theorems, any one-port network of 
resistors and energy sources can be converted into a simple voltage or 
current source with an internal or output resistance $R_0$. Moreover, 
the relationship between the voltage $V$ across and the current $I$ 
through the load is a straight line referred to as the {\bf load line}.
The absolute value of the slope $|\triangle V/\triangle I|=R_0$ of the
load line is the internal or output resistance of the network, as shown
in the figure below. On the other hand, the resistance $R_L$, which 
can be considered as the input resistance of the load, can also be 
represented on the graph as a straight line with its slope 
$\triangle V/\triangle I=R_L$. The intersection of these two straight
lines indicates the actual voltage $V$ and current $I$ with the load 
$R_L$.

\htmladdimg{../figures/loadline.gif}
% \htmladdimg{../figures/IVcharacteristic.gif}

The output resistance $R_0$ of a network can also be determined 
experimentally by varying the load $R_L$. Assume $(V_1, I_1)$ are 
associated with load $R_1$ and $(V_2, I_2)$ with load $R_2$, then 
the output resistance of the source network can be found to be:

\[ R_0=-\frac{\triangle V}{\triangle I}=-\frac{V_1-V_2}{I_1-I_2} \]

To show this, we assume the source network is converted to a voltage
source with $V_0$ and $R_0$, and use two different loads $R_1$ and
$R_2$ with
\[ I_1=\frac{V_0}{R_0+R_1},\;\;\;\;V_1=V_0\;\frac{R_1}{R_0+R_1},\;\;\;\;
   I_2=\frac{V_0}{R_0+R_2},\;\;\;\;V_2=V_0\;\frac{R_2}{R_0+R_2} \]
and
\[ 
\triangle I=I_1-I_2=V_0\;\left(\frac{1}{R_0+R_1}-\frac{1}{R_0+R_2}\right),
\;\;\;   \triangle V=V_1-V_2=V_0\;\left(\frac{R_1}{R_0+R_1}-\frac{R_2}{R_0+R_2}\right)
\]
The output resistance can therefore be found to be $R_0$ as expected:
\[ -\frac{\triangle V}{\triangle I}=-\frac{V_1-V_2}{I_1-I_2}=R_0 \]

Consider two extreme cases for the two loads $R_1$ and $R_2$:
\begin{itemize}
\item when $R_1=0$ (short-circuit), then we get the short-circuit 
  current: 
  \[ I_1=I_{sc}=V_0/R_0,\;\;\;\;\;\; V_1=0 \]
\item when $R_2=\infty$ (open-circuit), then we get the open-circuit
  voltage: 
  \[ V_2=V_{oc}=V_0,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;I_2=0 \]
\end{itemize}
and we have $\triangle V=V_1-V_2=-V_0$, $\triangle I=V_1-V_2=V_0/R_0$,
and the output resistance is found to be:
\[ R_0=-\frac{\triangle V}{\triangle I}=\frac{V_{oc}}{I_{sc}} \]

\end{comment}

\item {\bf Millman's Theorem:}

The voltage across a set of $N$ parallel branches of voltage source 
$V_i$ in series with $R_i$ ($i=1,\cdots,n$) is
\[
V=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{V_i}{R_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{R_i}}
\]

{\bf Proof:} (Homework)

\begin{comment}
Consider applying Norton's theorem to the circuit. The short-circuit current 
of these parallel branches can be found to be (superposition):
\[
I_{sc}=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{V_i}{R_i}
\]
and the total internal resistance is simply the parallel combination of the
branch resistances:
\[
R_0=\left(\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{R_i}\right)^{-1}
\]
Therefore the open-circuit voltage across these branches is 
\[
V_{oc}=I_{sc} R_0=\left(\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{V_i}{R_i}\right)\left(\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{R_i}\right)^{-1}
=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{V_i}{R_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{1}{R_i}}
\]
\end{comment}

\htmladdimg{../figures/MillmanThm.png}

This theorem can be augmented to include branches containing $R_j$ but no
voltage source ($V_j=0$), and branches containing a current source $I_j$. If 
a resistance $R_j$ is in series with $I_j$, it can be neglected (as it does
not affect the current). If a resistance $R_j$ is in parallel with $I_j$, 
they can be converted into a voltage source $V_j=I_jR_j$ in series with $R_j$. 


\item {\bf $\Delta$-Y Transformation}

\htmladdimg{../figures/DeltaY.gif}

The $\Delta$ configuration can be converted to $Y$ and vice versa. We
relate the $\Delta$ and $Y$ by realizing that the resistance $R'_{ab}$
between terminals a and b of $Y$ should be equal to that between the
same two terminals of $\Delta$:
\[ \left\{ \begin{array}{rr}
	R'_{ab}=R_a+R_b=R_{ab}||(R_{ac}+R_{bc})	\\
	R'_{ac}=R_a+R_c=R_{ac}||(R_{ab}+R_{bc}) \\
	R'_{bc}=R_b+R_c=R_{bc}||(R_{ab}+R_{ac}) \end{array} \right. \]
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Convert $\Delta$ to $Y$}: 

    Given $R_{ab}$, $R_{ac}$ and $R_{bc}$ of a $\Delta$, the three equations 
    above can be solved for $R_a$, $R_b$ and $R_c$ of the corresponding $Y$. 
    For example, subtracting the 3rd equation from the sum of the first two, 
    we get expression for $R_a$. The solutions are:
    \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{rr}
      R_a=R_{ab}R_{ac}/(R_{ab}+R_{ac}+R_{bc}) \\
      R_b=R_{ab}R_{bc}/(R_{ab}+R_{ac}+R_{bc}) \\
      R_c=R_{ac}R_{bc}/(R_{ab}+R_{ac}+R_{bc}) \\
    \end{array} \right. \]

  \item {\bf Convert $Y$ to $\Delta$}: 

    Reversely, given $R_a$, $R_b$ and $R_c$ of a $Y$, the same three 
    equations above can also be solved for $R_{ab}$, $R_{ac}$ and $R_{bc}$ 
    of the corresponding $\Delta$ to get:
    \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{rr}
      R_{ab}=R_a+R_b+R_aR_b/R_c	\\
      R_{ac}=R_a+R_c+R_aR_c/R_b	\\
      R_{bc}=R_b+R_c+R_bR_c/R_a	\end{array} \right. \]
\end{itemize}

The top circuit (a bridged T-network) in the following figure can
be converted into either of the two equivalent circuits below.

\htmladdimg{../figures/DeltaY1.gif}

\begin{itemize}
\item The $\Delta$ formed by $Z_1$, $Z_1$, and $Z_3$ can be converted 
  to a Y, which can then be combined with $Z_4$ to get a Y (bottom left):
  \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
  Y_1=Z_1Z_3/(Z_1+Z_2+Z_3) \\
  Y_2=Z_2Z_3/(Z_1+Z_2+Z_3) \\
  Y_3=Z_1Z_2/(Z_1+Z_2+Z_3)+Z_4 \\
  \end{array} \right. 
  \]
\item The Y formed by $Z_1$, $Z_2$, and $Z_4$ can be converted to a 
  $\Delta$, which can then be combined with $Z_3$ to get a $\Delta$ 
  (bottom right):
  \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
    X_1=Z_1+Z_4+Z_1Z_4/Z_2 \\
    X_2=Z_2+Z_4+Z_2Z_4/Z_1 \\
    X_3=(Z_1+Z_2+Z_1Z_2/Z_4) || Z_3 \\
  \end{array} \right. 
  \]
\end{itemize}
The resulting $\Delta$ and Y circuits are equivalent as it can be
shown that they can also be converted to each other with the same 
system variables.


{\bf Example 0:} Model the circuit in part (a) by Thevenin's theorem (b)
and Norton's theorem (c).

\htmladdimg{../figures/TheveninNorton1.png}

Find equivalent internal resistance when both energy sources
are turned off: $R_T=R_N=R_1$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Thevenin's equivalent circuit (b):

  Find open-circuit voltage: $V_T=V_{oc}=V_{ab}=V_0+I_0R_1$
\item Norton's equivalent circuit (c):

  Find short-circuit current (superposition):
  $I_N=I_{sc}=I_{ab}=V_0/R_1+I_0$
\end{itemize}
Note that the Thevenin's voltage source and the Norton's current 
source can be converted into each other:
  \[ 
  I_N=V_T/R_T=V_0/R_1+I_0,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  V_T=I_N R_N=V_0+I_0R_1	
  \]
Also note that the resistors $R_0$ and $R_2$ do not appear in either of
the equivalent circuit, because a voltage source provides a constant
voltage $V_0$ independent of any resistance in parallel, and a current 
source drives a constant current $I_0$, independent of any resistance 
in series. 

{\bf Example 1:} Find voltage $V$ across and current $I$ through $R_2$.

\htmladdimg{../figures/superposition1.gif}

Any one of the three methods can be used to solve the circuit:
\begin{itemize}

\item Node-voltage method:

  Assume the currents $I_1$ (left branch), $I_0$ and $I_2=I$ (right branch)
  all leave the top node, where the voltage is $V$ (with respect to the 
  bottom treated as ground). By KCL, we have
  \[
  I_0+I_1+I_2=I_0+\frac{V-V_0}{R_1}+\frac{V}{R_2}=0,\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.,}\;\;\;\;
  I_0R_1R_2+R_2(V-V_0)+R_1V=0 
  \]
  Solving for $V$, we get:
  \[
  V=\frac{R_2V_0-I_0R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2}
  =V_0\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}-I_0\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2} 
  \]
  and
  \[
  I=I_2=\frac{V}{R_2}=\frac{V_0}{R_1+R_2}-I_0\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2} 
  \]

  \htmladdimg{../figures/superposition.gif}

\item Superposition principle:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Find $V'$ and $I'$ with the current source off (open-circuit with 
    zero current):
    \[ 
    I'=\frac{V_0}{R_1+R_2},\;\;\;\;V'=I'R_2=V_0\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2} 
    \]
  \item Find $V''$ and $I''$ with the voltage source off (short-circuit with 
    zero voltage):
    \[
    I''=-I_0\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2},\;\;\;\;V''=I''R_2=-I_0\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2} 
    \]
    Both $I''$ and $V''$ have a negative sign as their direction and polarity are
    opposite to those of the assumed current and voltage.  
  \item Find the sum of the two partial results we get
    \[
    I=I'+I''=\frac{V_0}{R_1+R_2}-I_0\;\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}
    \]
    \[
    V=V'+V''=V_0\;\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}-I_0\;\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2}	
    \]
  \end{itemize}
\item Energy source conversion:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Treat $V_0$ and $R_1$ in the left branch as a non-ideal voltage
  source and convert that into a current source $I_1=V_0/R_1$ (upward);
  \item Combine the two parallel current sources to find $I$ (current
    devider):
    \[
    I=\left(\frac{V_0}{R_1}-I_0\right)\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}
    =\frac{V_0}{R_1+R_2}-I_0\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}
    \]
  \item Find $V$:
    \[
    V=R_2I=V_0\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}-I_0\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2}
    \]
  \end{itemize}

\item Thevenin's and Nordon's methods:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Thevenin's model: $R_T=R_1,\;\;V_T=V_0-I_0R_1$,
    \[
    I=\frac{V_T}{R_T+R_2}=\frac{V_0-I_0R_1}{R_1+R_2}
    =\frac{V_0}{R_1+R_2}-I_0\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}
    \]
  \item Norton's model: $R_N=R_1,\;\;I_N=V_0/R_1-I_0$.
    \[
    I=\left(\frac{V_T}{R_1}-I_0\right)\frac{R_T}{R_T+R_2}
    =\frac{V_0}{R_1+R_2}-I_0\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}
    \]
  \end{itemize}
  Then we get the voltage:
  \[
  V=R_2 I=V_0\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}-I_0\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2}
  \]

\end{itemize}


{\bf Example 2:} (Homework)

In general, the conversion from $\Delta$ to $Y$ is more useful as $Y$ 
is easier to analyze than $\Delta$. For example, the circuit in (a) 
below can be converted to that in (b) to find all the currents in the 
circuit:

\htmladdimg{../figures/DeltaYEx.gif}

Assume $V_0=225 V$, $R_0=1\Omega$, $R_1=40\Omega$, $R_2=36\Omega$, 
$R_3=50\Omega$, $R_4=55\Omega$, $R_5=10\Omega$, find the currents 
$I_0$, $I_1$, $I_2$, $I_3$, $I_4$, and $I_5$. 

{\bf Example 3: } In the circuit below, $V_0=18V$, $R_1=R_2=3\Omega$, 
$R_3=6\Omega$, $R_4=1.5\Omega$. Find the value of current $I$ when 
$R_5=2\Omega$. Then re-solve the problem when $R_5$ takes different
values of $1\Omega$ and $3\Omega$. Moreover, find the value of $R_5$ 
so that $I=0.5A$ as desired.

\htmladdimg{../figures/BridgeExample.png}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf The KVL method:} 

Consider three independent loops with clockwise loop currents:
\begin{itemize}
\item $I_0$ in the left loop ($V_0$, $R_2$, $R_4$) 
\item $I_1$ in the top loop ($R_2$,$R_1$, $R_5$) 
\item $I_2$ in the bottom loop ($R_3$, $R_4$, $R_5$)
\end{itemize}
Applying KVL to the three loops we get three simultaneous equations:
\[
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
R_2(I_0-I_1)+R_4(I_0-I_2)=3(I_0-I_1)+1.5(I_0-I_2)=18\\
R_1I_1+R_5(I_1-I_3)+R_2(I_1-I_0)=3I_1+2(I_1-I_3)+3(I_1-I_0)=0\\
R_3I_2+R_4(I_2-I_0)+R_5(I_2-I_1)=6I_2+1.5(I_2-I_0)+2(I_2-I_1)
=0\end{array}\right.
\]
Rearranging and solving the equations we get
\[
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
3I_0-2I_1-I_2=12\\-3I_0+8I_1-2I_2=0\\3I_0+4I_1-19I_2=0\end{array}\right.
\Longrightarrow
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
I_0=32/5\\I_1=14/5\\I_2=8/5
\end{array}\right.
\]
The node voltages can be found to be
\[
V_a=R_3I_2=6\times \frac{8}{5}=\frac{48}{5},\;\;\;\;\;\;
V_b=R_4(I_0-I_2)=1.5\times \frac{24}{5}=\frac{36}{5},\;\;\;\;\;\;
V_{ab}=V_a-V_b=\frac{12}{5}
\]
The current through $R_5$ is
\[
I_1-I_2=\frac{14}{5}-\frac{8}{5}=\frac{6}{5}=1.2\;A,
\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{or}\;\;\;\;\;\;
I=\frac{V_a-V_b}{R_5}=\frac{12/5\;V}{2\;\Omega}=1.2\;A
\]
We have to repeat the above for other values of $R_5$ to find
the current through it.

\item {\bf The KCL method:} 

Assume the bottom node is ground with 0 volt, then the voltage at 
the top node is known to be $V_0=18\,V$. Now we apply KCL to nodes
a and b to get two equations:
\[
\frac{V_a-V_0}{R_1}+\frac{V_a-V_b}{R_5}+\frac{V_a}{R_3}
=\frac{V_a-18}{3}+\frac{V_a-V_b}{2}+\frac{V_a}{6}=0
\]
\[
\frac{V_b-V_0}{R_2}+\frac{V_b-V_a}{R_5}+\frac{V_b}{R_4}
=\frac{V_b-18}{3}+\frac{V_b-V_a}{2}+\frac{V_b}{1.5}=0
\]
\[
\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}-V_a+3V_b=12\\2V_a-V_b=12\end{array}\right.
\;\;\;\;\;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;\;\;\;\;
\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}V_a=48/5\\V_b=36/5\end{array}\right.
\]
The current through $R_5$ is
\[
I=\frac{V_a-V_b}{R_5}=\frac{(48/5-36/5)\,V}{2\,\Omega}
=\frac{12/5\;V}{2\;\Omega}=\frac{6}{5}=1.2\;A
\]
We have to repeat the above for other values of $R_5$ to find
the current through it.

To find $R_5$ for the current through it to be $I=0.5$, we 
replace the current $I=(V_a-V_b)/2$ through $R_5$ in the two 
equations above by the desired $I=0.5$:
\[
\frac{V_a-18}{3}+0.5+\frac{V_a}{6}=0,\;\;\;\;\;\;
\frac{V_b-18}{3}-0.5+\frac{V_b}{1.5}=0
\]
Solving each of the two equations we get $V_a=11\,V$, $V_b=6.5\,V$,
and 
\[
R_5=\frac{V_a-V_b}{I}=\frac{11-6.5}{0.5}=9\;\Omega
\]

\item {\bf Method 3, $\Delta-Y$ conversion}

\htmladdimg{../figures/BridgeExampleDY.png}

To find $I$ through $R_5=2\Omega$, we first convert the $\Delta$ 
composed of $R_1$, $R_2$ and $R_5$ into a $Y$ composed of $R_a$, 
$R_b$ and $R_c$:
\[ 
R_c=\frac{R_1R_2}{R_1+R_2+R_5}=\frac{9}{8},\;\;\;\;
R_a=\frac{R_1R_5}{R_1+R_2+R_5}=\frac{3}{4},\;\;\;\;
R_b=\frac{R_2R_5}{R_1+R_2+R_5}=\frac{3}{4}
\]
Find overall load resistance of $V_0=18\,V$:
\[
R_0=R_c+(R_a+R_3) \;||\; (R_b+R_4)=\frac{45}{16}	
\]
Find overall current:
\[
I_0=\frac{V_0}{R_0}=\frac{18}{45/16}=\frac{32}{5}
\]
Find currents through $R_3$ and $R_4$ (current divider):
\[ 
I_a=I_0\;\frac{R_b+R_4}{(R_a+R_3)+(R_b+R_4)}=\frac{8}{5} 
\]
\[ 
I_b=I_0\;\frac{R_a+R_3}{(R_a+R_3)+(R_b+R_4)}=\frac{24}{5}
\]
Find voltage at points $a$ and $b$ (assuming the bottom node
is ground):
\[
V_a=I_a \times R_3=\frac{8 }{5} \times 6=\frac{48}{5},\;\;\;\;\;
V_b=I_b \times R_4=\frac{24}{5} \times 1.5=\frac{36}{5}	
\]
Find current $I$ through $R_5=2\Omega$:
\[
I=\frac{V_a-V_b}{R_5}=\frac{12}{5}\times \frac{1}{2}=1.2A
\]

For any of the methods above, the problem needs to be resolved
for $R_5=1\Omega$ and $R_5=3\Omega$, and it is hard to find a 
value of $R_5$ given the require current $I=0.5$.

\htmladdimg{../figures/BridgeExampleTh.png}

\item {\bf Method 4, Thevenin's theorem}

Solve the problem using Thevenin's theorem by the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Remove the branch in question from the circuit and treat the rest as
  a one-port network.
\item Model the one-port network by Thevenin's theorem, as an open circuit 
  voltage $V_T$ in series with an internal resistance $R_T$.
\item Put the branch in equation back as the load of the Thevenin equivalent
  network and find the desired current and voltage.
\end{itemize}

Specifically, we remove $R_5$ as the load of a network composed of all other
resistors $R_1$, $R_2$, $R_3$, $R_4$ and the voltage source $V_0=18V$, then
apply Thevenin's theorem to find the open-circuit voltage between the two
terminals a and b:
\[	
V_T=V_{oc}=V_0\frac{R_3}{R_1+R_3}-V_0\frac{R_4}{R_2+R_4}
=18 \left(\frac{6}{9}-\frac{1.5}{4.5}\right)=6V 
\]
and the internal resistance between a and b (with voltage source $V_0$ 
short-circuit):
\[ 
R_T=R_1\,||\,R_3+R_2\,||\,R_4
=\frac{3\times 6}{3+6}+\frac{3\times 1.5}{3+1.5}=3\Omega 
\]
Now the currents through $R_5$ of different values can be found by
\[
I=\frac{V_T}{R_T+R_5}
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item $R_5=1$, $I=6/(3+1)=1.5A$
\item $R_5=2$, $I=6/(3+2)=1.2A$
\item $R_5=3$, $I=6/(3+3)=1.0A$
\end{itemize}
and when $I=0.5$, $R_5=V_T/I-R_T=6/0.5-3=9$
\end{itemize}

{\bf Example 4: } The circuit below, often used in some control system, 
is composed of two voltages, two potentiometers, and a load resistor.
Assume:
\[
V_1=72V,\;\;\;\;V_2=80V,\;\;\;\;R_1=R_3=1.5\Omega,\;\;\;\;R_2=3\Omega,
\;\;\;\;R_4=2.5\Omega
\]
Find the current $I_L$ through the load resistor $R_L=1.5\Omega$. 

We denote the current through $R_i$ by $I_i$, and the voltage at the left 
and right ends of $R_L$ by $V_a$ and $V_b$, respectively, with respect to 
the bottom wire treated as the ground.

\htmladdimg{../figures/potentiometers.gif}

{\bf Superposition theorem}

Find $I'_L$ caused by voltage $V_1=72$, and then $I''_L$ caused by voltage
$V_2=80$, then get $I_L=I'_L+I''_L$.

\begin{itemize}

\item Short-circuit $V_2$. Assume $I'_L=8$, so that currents through
	$R_3=1.5$ and $R_4=2.5$ are $I_3=5$ and $I_4=3$, respectively
	(current divider), and $V_b=I_3R_3=I_4R_4=5\times 1.5=3\times 2.5=7.5$.
\item $V_a=R_L I'_L+V_b=1.5\times 8+7.5=19.5$, current through $R_2=3$
	is $I_2=V_a/R_2=19.5/3=6.5$, current through $R_1$ is 
	$I_1=I_2+I'_L=6.5+8=14.5$.
\item $V'_1=R_1\times I_1+V_a=1.5\times 14.5+19.5=41.25$. But $V_1=72$,
	we get scaling factor $V_1/V'_1=72/41.25=96/55$, and 
	$I'_L=8 \times 96/55$.

\item Short-circuit $V_1$. Assume $I''_L=3$, so that currents through
	$R_1=1.5$ and $R_2=3$ are, respectively, $I_1=2$ and $I_2=1$
	(current divider), and $V_a=R_1I_1=R_2I_2=1.5\times 2+3\times 1=3$.
\item $V_b=R_L I''_L+V_a=1.5\times 3+3=7.5$, current through $R_3=1.5$
	is $I_3=V_b/R_3=7.5/1.5=5$, current through $R_4$ is 
	$I_4=I_3+I''_L=5+3=8$.
\item $V'_2=R_4\times I_4+V_b=2.5\times 8+7.5=27.5$. But $V_2=80$,
	we get scaling factor $V_2/V'_2=80/27.5=32/11$, and 
	$I''_L=3\times 32/11=96/11$.

\item Finally, we get the load current:
\[	I_L=I'_L-I''_L=\frac{96\times 8}{55}-\frac{96}{11}=\frac{288}{55} \]

\end{itemize}

{\bf Thevenin's theorem}

Remove $R$, find open-circuit voltage $V_{ab}=V_a-V_b$ and equivalent
resistance $R$, then find $I_L=V_{ab}/(R+R_L)$.

\begin{itemize}
\item 
  $V_a=V_1\times R_2/(R_1+R_2)=72\times 3/(1.5+3)=48$

  $V_b=V_2\times R_3/(R_3+R_4)=80\times 1.5/(1.5+2.5)=30$

  $V_T=V_{ab}=V_a-V_b=48-30=18$
\item 
  $R_T=R_1 || R_2 + R_3 || R_4=3||1.5+2.5||1.5=7.75/4$
\item 
  \[ 
  I_L=\frac{V_T}{R_T+R_L}=\frac{18}{7.75/4+1.5}=\frac{288}{55} 
  \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Two-Port Networks}

{\bf Models of two-port networks}

Many complex, such as amplification circuits and filters, can be modeled
by a two-port network model as shown below. A two-port network is 
represented by four external variables: voltage $V_1$ and current $I_1$ 
at the input port, and voltage $V_2$ and current $I_2$ at the output port, 
so that the two-port network can be treated as a black box modeled by the
relationships between the four variables $V_1$, $V_2$, $I_1$ and $I_2$.
There exist six different ways to describe the relationships between these 
variables, depending on which two of the four variables are given, while 
the other two can always be derived. 

\begin{comment}
{\bf Note: } All voltages and currents below are complex variables and
represented by phasors containing both magnitude and phase angle. However, 
for convenience the phasor notation $\dot{V}$ and $\dot{I}$ are replaced by 
$V$ and $I$ respectively.
\end{comment}

\htmladdimg{../figures/twoportmodel.gif}

If the network is linear, i.e., each variable can be expressed as a linear
function of some two other variables, then we have the following models:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Z or impedance model:} Given two currents $I_1$ and $I_2$ 
  find voltages $V_1$ and $V_2$ by:
  \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{l} V_1=Z_{11}I_1+Z_{12}I_2 \\
    V_2=Z_{21}I_1+Z_{22}I_2 \end{array} \right.\;\;\;\;\;
  \left[ \begin{array}{l} V_1 \\ V_2\end{array} \right]=
  \left[ \begin{array}{ll} Z_{11} & Z_{12}\\Z_{21} & Z_{22}\end{array}\right]
  \left[ \begin{array}{l} I_1 \\ I_2\end{array} \right]
  ={\bf Z}\left[ \begin{array}{l} I_1 \\ I_2\end{array} \right] \]
  Here all four parameters $Z_{11}$, $Z_{12}$, $Z_{21}$, and $Z_{22}$ represent
  impedance. In particular, $Z_{21}$ and $Z_{12}$ are {\bf transfer impedances}, 
  defined as the ratio of a voltage $V_1$ (or $V_2$) in one part of a network to 
  a current $I_2$ (or $I_1$) in another part $Z_{12}=V_1/I_2$. ${\bf Z}$ is a 2 
  by 2 matrix containing all four parameters.

\item {\bf Y or admittance model:} Given two voltages $V_1$ and $V_2$,
  find currents $I_1$ and $I_2$ by:
  \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{l} I_1=Y_{11}V_1+Y_{12}V_2 \\
    I_2=Y_{21}V_1+Y_{22}V_2 \end{array} \right.\;\;\;\;\;
  \left[ \begin{array}{l} I_1 \\ I_2\end{array} \right]=
  \left[ \begin{array}{ll} Y_{11} & Y_{12}\\Y_{21} & Y_{22}\end{array}\right]
  \left[ \begin{array}{l} V_1 \\ V_2\end{array} \right]
  ={\bf Y}\left[ \begin{array}{l} V_1 \\ V_2\end{array} \right]  \]
  Here all four parameters $Y_{11}$, $Y_{12}$, $Y_{21}$, and $Y_{22}$ represent
  admittance. In particular, $Y_{21}$ and $Y_{12}$ are {\bf transfer admittances}. 
  ${\bf Y}$ is the corresponding parameter matrix.

\item {\bf A or transmission model:} Given $V_2$ and $I_2$, find 
  $V_1$ and $I_1$ by:
  \[\left\{ \begin{array}{l} 
    V_1=A_{11}V_2+A_{12}(-I_2) \\
    I_1=A_{21}V_2+A_{22}(-I_2) \end{array} \right.\;\;\;\;\;
  \left[ \begin{array}{l} V_1 \\ I_1\end{array} \right]=
  \left[ \begin{array}{ll} A_{11} & A_{12}\\A_{21} & A_{22}\end{array}\right]
  \left[ \begin{array}{r} V_2 \\ -I_2\end{array} \right]
  ={\bf A}\left[ \begin{array}{r} V_2 \\ -I_2\end{array} \right]  \]
  Here $A_{11}$ and $A_{22}$ are dimensionless coefficients, $A_{12}$ is impedance 
  and $A_{21}$ is admittance. A negative sign is added to the output current $I_2$ 
  in the model, so that the direction of the current is out-ward, for easy
  analysis of a cascade of multiple network models.

\item {\bf H or hybrid model:} Given $V_2$ and $I_1$, find $V_1$ and $I_2$ by:
  \[\left\{ \begin{array}{l} 
    V_1=H_{11}I_1+H_{12}V_2 \\
    I_2=H_{21}I_1+H_{22}V_2 \end{array} \right.\;\;\;\;\;
  \left[ \begin{array}{l} V_1 \\ I_2\end{array} \right]=
  \left[ \begin{array}{ll} H_{11} & H_{12}\\H_{21} & H_{22}\end{array}\right]
  \left[ \begin{array}{l} I_1 \\ V_2\end{array} \right]
  ={\bf H}\left[ \begin{array}{l} I_1 \\ V_2\end{array} \right]  \]
  Here $H_{12}$ and $H_{21}$ are dimensionless coefficients, $H_{11}$ is 
  impedance and $H_{22}$ is admittance. 

\end{itemize}

{\bf Generalization to nonlinear circuits}

The two-port models can also be applied to a nonlinear circuit if the 
variations of the variables are small ({\em small signal models}) and 
therefore the nonlinear behavior of the circuit can be piece-wise 
linearized. Assume $z=f(x,y)$ is a nonlinear function of variables 
$x$ and $y$. If the variations $\triangle x$ and $\triangle y$ are 
small, the function can be approximated by a linear model 
\[
\triangle z=\triangle f(x,y)=\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\triangle x +
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\triangle y  
\]
with the linear coefficients
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=\lim_{\triangle x\rightarrow 0}
\frac{\triangle f}{\triangle x}\bigg|_{\triangle y=0}
\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}=\lim_{\triangle y\rightarrow 0}
\frac{\triangle f}{\triangle y}\bigg|_{\triangle x=0}
\]

{\bf Finding the model parameters}

For each of the four types of models, the four parameters can be found
from variables $V_1$, $V_2$, $I_1$ and $I_2$ of a network by the following.
\begin{itemize}
\item For Z-model:
  \[
  Z_{11}=\frac{V_1}{I_1}\bigg|_{I_2=0},\;\;\;\;
  Z_{12}=\frac{V_1}{I_2}\bigg|_{I_1=0},\;\;\;\;
  Z_{21}=\frac{V_2}{I_1}\bigg|_{I_2=0},\;\;\;\;
  Z_{22}=\frac{V_2}{I_2}\bigg|_{I_1=0}
  \]
\item For Y-model:
  \[
  Y_{11}=\frac{I_1}{V_1}\bigg|_{V_2=0},\;\;\;\;
  Y_{12}=\frac{I_1}{V_2}\bigg|_{V_1=0},\;\;\;\;
  Y_{21}=\frac{I_2}{V_1}\bigg|_{V_2=0},\;\;\;\;
  Y_{22}=\frac{I_2}{V_2}\bigg|_{Y_1=0},\;\;\;\;
  \]
\item For A-model:
  \[
  A_{11}=\frac{V_1}{V_2}\bigg|_{I_2=0},\;\;\;\;
  A_{12}=\frac{V_1}{I_2}\bigg|_{V_2=0},\;\;\;\;
  A_{21}=\frac{I_1}{V_2}\bigg|_{I_2=0},\;\;\;\;
  A_{22}=\frac{I_1}{I_2}\bigg|_{V_2=0}
  \]
\item For H-model:
  \[
  H_{11}=\frac{V_1}{I_1}\bigg|_{V_2=0},\;\;\;\;
  H_{12}=\frac{V_1}{V_2}\bigg|_{I_1=0},\;\;\;\;
  H_{21}=\frac{I_2}{I_1}\bigg|_{V_2=0},\;\;\;\;
  H_{22}=\frac{I_2}{V_2}\bigg|_{I_1=0}
  \]
\end{itemize}

If we further define
\[
  {\bf V}=[V_1, V_2]^T,\;\;\;\;\;\;{\bf I}=[I_1, I_2]^T	
\]
then the Z-model and Y-model above can be written in matrix form:
\[
  {\bf V}={\bf Z} {\bf I},\;\;\;\;\;\;
  {\bf I}={\bf Y} {\bf V},\;\;\;\;{\bf Y}={\bf Z}^{-1}		
\]

{\bf Example: } 

\htmladdimg{../figures/networkLC.gif}

Find the Z-model and Y-model of the circuit shown.
\[
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} V_1=Z_{11}I_1+Z_{12}I_2 \\
  V_2=Z_{21}I_1+Z_{22}I_2 \end{array} \right.
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item First assume $I_2=0$, we get

  \[
  Z_{11}=V_1/I_1=j\omega L+1/j\omega C,\;\;\;\;\;Z_{21}=V_2/I_1=1/j\omega C 
  \]
\item Next assume $I_1=0$, we get
  \[
  Z_{22}=V_2/I_2=1/j\omega C,\;\;\;\;\;\;Z_{12}=V_1/I_2=1/j\omega C 
  \]
\end{itemize}
The parameters of the Y-model can be found as the inverse of $Z$:
\[
\left[\begin{array}{cc}Y_{11}&Y_{12}\\Y_{21}&Y_{22}\end{array}\right]
=\left[\begin{array}{cc}Z_{11}&Z_{12}\\Z_{21}&Z_{22}\end{array}\right]^{-1}
=\left[\begin{array}{cc}j\omega L+1/j\omega C & 1/j\omega C\\
    1/j\omega C & 1/j\omega \end{array}\right]^{-1}
=\left[\begin{array}{cc}1/j\omega L & -1/j\omega L\\
    -1/j\omega L & j\omega C+1/j\omega L\end{array}\right] 
\]
	
{\bf Note:} 
\[
\left[ \begin{array}{rr} a & b \\ c & d \end{array} \right]^{-1}
=\frac{1}{ad-bc}\left[ \begin{array}{rr} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{array} \right]
\]

{\bf Combinations of two-port models}

\begin{itemize}
\item Series connection of two 2-port networks: 
	${\bf Z}={\bf Z}_1+{\bf Z}_2$
\item Parallel connection of two 2-port networks: 
	${\bf Y}={\bf Y}_1+{\bf Y}_2$
\item Cascade connection of two 2-port networks:
	${\bf A}={\bf A}_1 \cdot {\bf A}_2$
\end{itemize}

\htmladdimg{../figures/networkmodels1.gif}

{\bf Example:} A The circuit shown below contains a two-port network (e.g., a 
filter circuit, or an amplification circuit) represented by a Z-model:
\[ {\bf Z}=\left[\begin{array}{ll} Z_{11} & Z_{12} \\ 
	Z_{21} & Z_{22} \end{array}\right]
	=\left[\begin{array}{rr} 4\Omega & j3\Omega \\ 
	j3\Omega & 2\Omega \end{array}\right]	\]
The input voltage is $V_0=3\angle 0^\circ$ with an internal impedance 
$Z_0=5\Omega$ and the load impedance is $R_L=4\Omega$. Find the two voltages 
$V_1$, $V_2$ and two currents $I_1$, $I_2$.

\htmladdimg{../figures/networkexample1.gif}

{\bf Method 1:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item First, according the Z-model, we have
  \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l} V_1=Z_{11}I_1+Z_{12}I_2= 4I_1+j3I_2 \\
    V_2=Z_{21}I_1+Z_{22}I_2=j3I_1+ 2I_2 \end{array} \right.	
  \]
\item Second, two more equations can be obtained from the circuit:
  \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l} V_1=V_0-Z_0 I_1=3-5I_1 \\
    V_2=-Z_L I_2=-4 I_2 \end{array} \right.	
  \]
\item Substituting the last two equations for $V_1$ and $V_2$ into the 
  first two, we get
  \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l} 9I_1+j3I_2=3 \\ j3I_1+6I_2=0 \end{array} \right. 
  \]
\item Solving these we get 
  \[
  I_1=\frac{2}{7},\;\;\;\;\;I_2=-\frac{j}{7} 
  \]
\item Then we can get the voltages
  \[
  V_1=\frac{11}{7},\;\;\;\;\;V_2=\frac{j4}{7} 
  \]
\end{itemize}

{\bf Method 2:} We can also use Thevenin's theorem to treat everything 
before the load impedance as an equivalent voltage source with Thevenin's 
voltage $V_T$ and resistance $R_T$, and the output voltage $V_2$ and 
current $I_2$ can be found.

\begin{itemize}
\item Find $Z_T=V_2/I_2$ with voltage $V_0$ short-circuit:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The Z-model:
    \[
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l} V_1=Z_{11}I_1+Z_{12}I_2=4I_1+j3I_2	\\
      V_2=Z_{21}I_1+Z_{22}I_2=j3I_1+2I_2 \end{array} \right. 
    \]
  \item Also due to the short-circuit of voltage source $V_0=0$, we have
    \[
    V_1=V_0-I_1 Z_0=0-5I_1	
    \]
  \item equating the two expressions for $V_1$, we get
    \[
    4I_1+j3I_2=-5I_1,\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;I_1=-\frac{j}{3} I_2	
    \]
  \item Substituting this $I_1$ into the equation for $V_2$ above, we get
    \[
    V_2=j3I_1+2I_2=I_2+2I_2=3I_2 
    \]
  \item Find $Z_T=V_2/I_2$:
    \[
    Z_T=\frac{V_2}{I_2}=3	
    \]
  \end{itemize}
\item Find open-circuit voltage $V_T$ with $I_2=0$:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Since the load is an open-circuit, $I_2=0$, we have
    \[ 
    \left\{ \begin{array}{l} V_1=Z_{11}I_1=4I_1 \\
      V_2=Z_{21}I_1=j3 I_1 \end{array} \right. 
    \]
  \item Find $I_1$:
    \[
    I_1=\frac{V_0-V_1}{Z_0}=\frac{3-4I_1}{5}	
    \]
    Solving this to get $I_1=1/3$
  \item Find open-circuit voltage $V_T=V_2$:
    \[
    V_2=Z_{21}I_1=j3 \frac{1}{3}=j	
    \]
  \end{itemize}
\item Find load voltage $V_2$:
  \[
  V_2=\frac{V_T}{Z_T+Z_L}\;Z_L=\frac{j}{3+4}\;4=\frac{j4}{7} 
  \]
\item Find load voltage $I_2$:
  \[
  I_2=-\frac{V_2}{Z_L}=-\frac{j4}{7}\;\frac{1}{4}=-\frac{j}{7} 
  \]
\end{itemize}


{\bf Principle of reciprocity}:
 
\htmladdimg{../figures/reciprocal.gif}

Consider the example circuit on the left above, which can be simplified 
as the network in the middle. The voltage source is in the branch on the
left, while the current $\dot{I}_2$ is in the branch on the right, which
can be found to be (current divider):
\[ \dot{I}_2=\frac{V}{Z_1+Z_2 Z_3/(Z_2+Z_3)}\;\frac{Z_3}{Z_2+Z_3}
=V \frac{Z_3}{Z_1Z_2+Z_1Z_3+Z_2Z_3} \]
We next interchange the positions of the voltage source and the current, 
so that the voltage source is in the branch on the right and the current 
to be found is in the branch on the left, as shown on the right of the 
figure above. The current can be found to be
\[ \dot{I}_1=\frac{V}{Z_2+Z_1 Z_3/(Z_1+Z_3)}\frac{Z_3}{Z_1+Z_3}
=V \frac{Z_3}{Z_1Z_2+Z_1Z_3+Z_2Z_3} \]
The two currents $\dot{I}_1$ and $\dot{I}_2$ are exactly the same! This
result illustrates the following {\bf reciprocity principle}, which can 
be proven in general:

{\em 
In any passive (without energy sources), 
linear network, if a voltage $V$ applied in branch 1 causes a current $I$ in 
branch 2, then this voltage $V$ applied in branch 2 will cause the same current
$I$ in branch 1.}

This reciprocity principle can also be stated as:

{\em In any passive, linear network, the transfer impedance $Z_{12}$ is equal 
to the reciprocal transfer impedance $Z_{21}$.}

Based on this reciprocity principle, any complex passive linear network can
be modeled by either a T-network or a $\Pi$-network:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf T-Network Model:}
    \htmladdimg{../figures/Tmodel.gif}

    From this T-model, we get
    \[	\left\{ \begin{array}{l} V_1=(Z_1+Z_3)I_1+Z_3I_2=Z_{11}I_1+Z_{12}I_2 \\
      V_2=Z_3I_1+(Z_2+Z_3)I_2=Z_{21}I_1+Z_{22}I_2  \end{array} \right. \]
    Comparing this with the Z-model, we get
    \[ Z_{11}=Z_1+Z_3,\;\;\;\;\;Z_{22}=Z_2+Z_3,\;\;\;\;\;Z_{12}=Z_{21}=Z_3	\]
    Solving these equations for $Z_1$, $Z_2$ and $Z_3$, we get
    \[ Z_1=Z_{11}-Z_{12},\;\;\;\;Z_2=Z_{22}-Z_{21},\;\;\;\;Z_3=Z_{12}=Z_{21} \]

  \item {\bf $\Pi$-Network Model:}
    \htmladdimg{../figures/Pmodel.gif}

    From this $\Pi$-model, we get:
    \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{l} 
      I_1=Y_1V_1+Y_3(V_1-V_2)=(Y_1+Y_3)V_1-Y_3V_2=Y_{11}V_1+Y_{12}V_2 \\
      I_2=Y_3(V_2-V_1)+Y_2V_2=-Y_3V_1+(Y_2+Y_3)V_2=Y_{21}V_1+Y_{22}V_2 \end{array} \right. \]
    Comparing this with the Y-model, we get
    \[ Y_{11}=Y_1+Y_3,\;\;\;\;\;Y_{22}=Y_2+Y_3,\;\;\;\;\;Y_{12}=Y_{21}=-Y_3	\]
    Solving these equations for $Y_1$, $Y_2$ and $Y_3$, we get
    \[ Y_1=Y_{11}+Y_{12},\;\;\;\;Y_2=Y_{22}+Y_{21},\;\;\;\;Y_3=-Y_{12}=-Y_{21} \]
\end{itemize}

{\bf Example 1:} Convert the given T-network to a $\Pi$ network.

\htmladdimg{../figures/TPmodelexample.gif}

{\bf Solution:} Given $Z_1=j5$, $Z_2=-j5$, $Z_3=1$, we get its Z-model:
\[  Z_{11}=Z_1+Z_3=1+j5,\;\;\;\;Z_{22}=Z_2+Z_3=1-j5,\;\;\;\;Z_{12}=Z_{21}=Z_3=1 \]
The Z-model can be expressed in matrix form:
\[	\left[ \begin{array}{l} V_1 \\ V_2\end{array} \right]=
	\left[ \begin{array}{cc} Z_{11} & Z_{12} \\ Z_{21} & Z_{22} \end{array} \right]
	\left[ \begin{array}{l} I_1 \\ I_2\end{array} \right]
=	\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1+j5 & 1 \\ 1 & 1-j5 \end{array} \right]
	\left[ \begin{array}{l} I_1 \\ I_2\end{array} \right]
\]
This Z-model can be converted into a Y-model:
\[	\left[ \begin{array}{l} I_1 \\ I_2\end{array} \right]=
	\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1+j5 & 1 \\ 1 & 1-j5 \end{array} \right]^{-1}
	\left[ \begin{array}{l} V_1 \\ V_2\end{array} \right]
=\frac{1}{25}
	\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1-j5 & -1 \\ -1 & 1+j5 \end{array} \right]
	\left[ \begin{array}{l} V_1 \\ V_2\end{array} \right]
=	\left[ \begin{array}{cc} Y_{11} & Y_{12} \\ Y_{21} & Y_{22} \end{array} \right]
	\left[ \begin{array}{l} V_1 \\ V_2\end{array} \right]
\]
This Y-model can be converted to a $\Pi$ network:
\[ Y_1=Y_{11}+Y_{12}=-j/5,\;\;\;\;Z_2=Y_{22}+Y_{21}=j/5,\;\;\;\;
	Y_3=-Y_{21}=-Y_{12}=1/25 \]
These admittances can be further converted into impedances:
\[ Z_1=1/Y_1=5j,\;\;\;\;Z_2=1/Y_2=-j5,\;\;\;\;Z_3=1/Y_3=25	\]
The same results can be obtained by Y to delta conversion.


{\bf Example 2:} Consider the ideal transformer shown in the figure below. 
Assume $R_0=10\Omega$, $R_L=5\Omega$, and the turn ratio is $n=n_1/n_2=2$. 
Describe this circuit as a two-port network.

\htmladdimg{../figures/transformerexample2.gif}

\begin{itemize}
\item Set up basic equations:
\[	\left\{ \begin{array}{l} 
	V_1=10\;I_1+2\;V_2 \\ I_2-V_2/5=-2\;I_1 \end{array} \right. \]
\item Rearrange the equations in the form of a Z-model. The second equation is
\[	V_2=10\;I_1+5\;I_2	\]
Substituting into the first equation, we get
\[	V_1=30\;I_1+10\;I_2	\]
The Z-model is:
\[	\left[ \begin{array}{l} V_1 \\ V_2 \end{array} \right]=
	\left[ \begin{array}{rr} Z_{11} & Z_{12} \\ Z_{21} & Z_{22} \end{array} \right]
	\left[ \begin{array}{l} I_1 \\ I_2 \end{array} \right]
=	\left[ \begin{array}{rr} 30 & 10 \\ 10 & 5 \end{array} \right]
	\left[ \begin{array}{l} I_1 \\ I_2 \end{array} \right]
\]
As $Z_{12}=Z_{21}=10$, this is a reciprocal network.
\end{itemize}
Alternatively, we can set up the equations in terms of the currents:

\begin{itemize}
\item
\[	\left\{ \begin{array}{l} 
	I_1=(V_1-2\;V_2)/10 \\ I_2=-2\;I_1+V_2/5 \end{array} \right. \]
\item Rearrange the equations in the form of a Y-model. The first equation is
\[	I_1=V_1/10-V_2/5	\]
\item Substituting into the second equation, we get
\[	I_2=-V_1/5+2V_2/5+V_2/5=-V_1/5+3V_2/5	\]
The Y-model is:
\[	\left[ \begin{array}{l} I_1 \\ I_2 \end{array} \right]=
	\left[ \begin{array}{rr} Y_{11} & Y_{12} \\ Y_{21} & Y_{22} \end{array} \right]
	\left[ \begin{array}{l} V_1 \\ V_2 \end{array} \right]
=	\left[ \begin{array}{rr} 1/10 & -1/5 \\ -1/5 & 3/5 \end{array} \right]
	\left[ \begin{array}{l} V_1 \\ V_2 \end{array} \right] \]
\end{itemize}
Finally, we can verify that ${\bf Z}^{-1}={\bf Y}$
\[ {\bf Z}^{-1}=\left[ \begin{array}{rr} 30 & 10 \\ 10 & 5 \end{array} \right]^{-1}
	=\frac{1}{50}\left[ \begin{array}{rr} 5 & -10 \\ -10 & 30 \end{array} \right]
	=\left[ \begin{array}{rr} 1/10 & -1/5 \\ -1/5 & 3/5 \end{array} \right]
	={\bf Y}	\]

\subsection*{Active Components and Circuits}

All circuits we have discussed so far are only composed of passive components 
(resistors, capacitors and inductors) driven by current and/or voltage 
sources. Later we will consider circuits containing active components such
as bipolar junction transistors (BJT), field-effect transistors (FET), 
\htmladdnormallink{operational amplifiers (op-amps)}{../opamp/index.html}
containing many transistors, and voltage amplifiers. These active components
can be considered as controlled voltage or current sources as functions 
(typically linear) of the input voltage or current. 

\begin{itemize}
\item We first consider modeling the overall function and performance of 
  an active component (instead of its internal structure and implementation
  which may be very complicated) by the following three parameters:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Input impedance (resistance) $r_{in}$:} It is desirable to have
    a large $r_{in}$ so that little input current is drawn from the source, 
    i.e., the source is minimally affected by the amplifier as a load. 
    Ideally $r_{in}=\infty$. 
  \item {\bf Output impedance (resistance) $r_{out}$:} It is desirable to 
    have a small $r_{out}$ so that little voltage drop across this resistance 
    will result when the load of the amplifier draws a current from the 
    amplifier, i.e., the load will minimally affect the output voltage of 
    the amplifier.
  \item {\bf Voltage gain $G_v$} (or $A$ in op-amp):
    The open-circuit voltage $v_{out}$ across the output port is related 
    to the input voltage $v_{in}$ by $v_{out}=G_v v_{in}$.
  \item {\bf Current gain $G_a$} (or $\beta$ in BJT transistor):
    The short-circuit current $i_{out}$ through the output port is related 
    to the input current $i_{in}$ by $i_{out}=G_a i_{in}$.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \htmladdimg{../figures/2portExamples.png}

  \htmladdimg{../figures/AmplifierModel2.png}

  {\bf Example 1:} Consider the circuit below containing an active component,
  a voltage amplifier, model by the three parameters $r_{in}$, $r_{out}$ and 
  $G_v$, dirven by either a current source $i_s=v_s/R_S$ or a voltage $v_s=i_sR_S$ 
  with internal resistance $R_S$:

  \htmladdimg{../figures/voltageamplifierex1.gif}
  \htmladdimg{../figures/voltageamplifierex2.gif}

  \[
  v_{in}=i_s (R_S \,||\, r_{in})=i_s \frac{R_S r_{in}}{R_S+r_{in}} 
  =v_s \frac{r_{in}}{R_S+r_{in}} 
  \]
  \[
  v_{out}=G_v v_{in} \frac{R_L}{R_L+r_{out}}
  =G_v i_s \frac{R_S r_{in}}{R_S+r_{in}} \frac{R_L}{R_L+r_{out}} 
  =G_v v_s \frac{r_{in}}{R_S+r_{in}} \frac{R_L}{R_L+r_{out}} 
  \]
  Given $R_S$ and $R_L$, we want to maximize $v_{out}$ by
  maximizing $r_{in}$ and minimizing $r_{out}$.

  \begin{comment}
    {\bf Example 2:}
    \[ v_{in}=v_s \frac{r_{in}}{R_S+r_{in}} \]
    \[ v_{out}=G_v v_{in} \frac{R_L}{R_L+r_{out}}
    =G_v v_s \frac{r_{in}}{R_S+r_{in}} \frac{R_L}{R_L+r_{out}} \]

    The alternative definitions of these voltage, current, and power 
    gains may be used, depending on the specific applications.
  \end{comment}

\item We next consider a circuit containing an active circuit such as 
  a transistor, an op-amp, or a voltage amplifier. This circuit can be 
  modeled as a two-port network with input port between terminals A 
  and B and output port between terminals C and D, and described in 
  terms of the three parameters, the open-circuit voltage gain, the 
  input resistance and output resistance:

  \htmladdimg{../figures/TwoPortModel.png}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Input resistance $R_{in}$:} This is the resistance between 
    the two terminals A and B of the input port, while a load $R_L$ is 
    connected to the output port between terminals C and D:
    \[ 
    R_{in}=\frac{\mbox{voltage $v_{in}$ across the input port}}
    {\mbox{current $i_{in}$ through the input port}} 
    \]
    In general $R_{in}$ is affected by the load $R_L$.
  \item {\bf Output resistance $R_{out}$:} According to Thevenin's theorem, 
    any one-port network can be treated as an ideal voltage source $v_T$ in 
    series with a resistance $R_T$. We apply this theorem to the output port
    and define the output resistance as the Thevenin resistance 
    \[
    R_{out}=\frac{\mbox{open-circuit voltage}}{\mbox{short-circuit current}}
    =\frac{v_{oc}=v_T\;\;(R_L=\infty)}{i_{sc}=v_T/R_T\;\;(R_L=0)}=R_T
    \]
    while a voltage source $v_s$ with an internal resistance $R_S$ is applied 
    to the input port. In general, $R_{out}$ is affected by $R_S$ of the source.
  \item {\bf The open-circuit voltage gain $A_{oc}$:} This is the ratio of the 
    open-circuit output voltage $v_{oc}$ ($R_L=\infty$) to an ideal voltage 
    source $v_s$ 
    \[
    A_{oc}=\frac{\mbox{open-circuit voltage}}{\mbox{ideal voltage source}}
    =\frac{v_{oc}}{v_{in}}
    \]
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{comment}
  The performance of such a circuit containing active components can also
  be described by terms such as ``voltage gain'' $G_V$, ``current gain'' 
  $G_I$, and ``power gain'' $G_P$, which can be found based on the specific
  circuits. They are defined as below:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Voltage gain $G_V$:} defined as the ratio of the output 
    voltage to the source voltage:
    \[
    G_V=\frac{v_{out}}{v_s}
    =A\frac{r_{in}}{R_S+r_{in}} \frac{R_L}{R_L+r_{out}} 
    \]
    For the output of the voltage amplifier to be as high as possible,
    we would like to have ideally $r_{in}=\infty$ and $r_{out}=0$, so that
    the output voltage is maximized $v_{out}=A v_s$ and the gain is $G_V=A$.

  \item {\bf Current gain $G_I$:} defined as the ratio of the output 
    current to the input current:
    \[
    G_I=\frac{i_{out}}{i_{in}}=\frac{A v_{in}/(r_{out}+R_L)}{i_{in}}
    =\frac{A r_{in}i_{in}/(r_{out}+R_L)}{i_{in}}
    =\frac{A r_{in}}{r_{out}+R_L}
    \]
    Ideally, when $r_{in}=\infty$, $r_{out}=0$, we have $G_I=\infty$.

  \item {\bf Power gain $G_P$: } defined as the ratio of the power 
    delivered to the load to that to the amplifier:
    \[
    G_P=\frac{v_{out}^2/R_L}{v_{in}^2/r_{in}}=G_V^2 \frac{r_{in}}{R_L} 
    \]
  \end{itemize}
  \end{comment}

\end{itemize}

{\bf Example 2:} 

\htmladdimg{../figures/voltageamplifierex3.gif}

Find $R_{in}$, $R_{out}$, and $A_{oc}$ of this two-port network containing
$R_1$ and $R_2$ as well as the amplifier modeled by $r_{in}$, $r_{out}$ 
and the open-circuit voltage gain $G_v$. 

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Input resistance:} By inspection, the input resistance of this
  2-port network can be found to be $R_{in}=R_1+r_{in}$.

\item {\bf Output resistance:} We assume the internal voltage source 
  is the Thevenin voltage $v_T$, and get the open-circuit voltage 
  $v_{oc}=v_T R_2/(r_{out}+R_2)$ and the short-circuit current
  $i_{sc}=v_T/r_{out}$. The output resistance is
  \[ 
  R_{out}=\frac{v_{oc}}{i_{sc}}=\frac{r_{out}R_2}{r_{out}+R_2}=r_{out}\,||\,R_2 
  \]
  Alternatively, $R_{out}$ can be found as the resistance between the two 
  terminals C and D of the output port when the voltage source of the amplifier 
  is turned off (short-circuit), i.e., $R_{out}=r_{out}\,||\,R_2$.

\item {\bf Open-circuit voltage gain:} This is the ratio of the voltage $V_{CD}$
  across the output port to the voltage $V_{AB}$ across the input port, when the
  output port is an open circuit, i.e., $R_L=\infty$. 
  \begin{eqnarray}
    v_{in}&=&V_{AB}\frac{r_{in}}{R_1+r_{in}}  \nonumber \\
    V_{CD}&=&A v_{in} \frac{R_2}{r_{out}+R_2}=A V_{AB}\frac{r_{in}}{R_1+r_{in}} 
    \frac{R_2}{r_{out}+R_2} \nonumber \\
    A_{oc}&=&\frac{V_{CD}}{V_{AB}}=\frac{A R_2 r_{in}}{(R_1+r_{in})(r_{out}+R_2)} 
    \stackrel{r_{in}\rightarrow\infty\;\;r_{out}=0}{\Longrightarrow}A
    \nonumber 
  \end{eqnarray}
\end{itemize}
This 2-port network modeled as a voltage amplifier with $R_{in}$, $R_{out}$
and $A_{oc}$ can be used in more complicated circuits.

{\bf Example 3:} 

A 2-port network with a voltage aplifier modeled by $r_{in}$, $r_{out}$ and
voltage gain $A$ on the left can be modeled by the circuit on the right. 
Find the parameters $R_{in}$, $R_{out}$ and $A_{oc}$ of the two-port network 
with the voltage amplifier embedded.

\htmladdimg{../figures/voltageamplifierex4.gif}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Open-circuit voltage gain:} As the output port is open circuit, 
  the output current is zero and so is the voltage drop across $r_{out}$.
  Applying an ideal voltage source $v_s$ to the input, we get the voltage 
  $v_{in}$ across $r_{in}$ and $v_1$ across $R_1$, respectively:
  \[
  v_{in}=v_s \frac{r_{in}}{R_1+r_{in}},\;\;\;\;\;
  v_1=v_s \frac{R_1}{R_1+r_{in}} 
  \]
  The open-circuit voltage across output port is therefore:
  \[
  v_{oc}=v_1+A v_{in}=v_s \frac{R_1}{R_1+r_{in}}+Av_s\frac{r_{in}}{R_1+r_{in}}
  =v_s \frac{R_1+A r_{in}}{R_1+r_{in}}  
  \]
  The open-circuit voltage gain can be found as the ratio of the open-circuit
  output voltage to the input voltage:
  \[
  A_{oc}=\frac{v_{oc}}{v_s}=\frac{R_1+A r_{in}}{R_1+r_{in}}<A  
  \]
  if $R_1=0$, the circuit is reduced to the original voltage amplifier and we
  have $A_{oc}=A$.

\item {\bf Output resistance:} 
  \begin{comment}
  We first find the short-circuit current $i_{sc}$ at the output port. 
  Assume a voltage source $v_s$ with $R_S=0$ is applied to the input 
  port while the output port is short-circuited. Applying KVL to the 
  two loops of the circuit, we get:
  \begin{eqnarray}
    v_s&=&(R_1+r_{in})i_{in}-R_1 i_{sc} 
    \nonumber\\
    A v_{in}&=&A r_{in} i_{in}=(r_{out}+R_1) i_{sc}-R_1 i_{in} 
    \nonumber
  \end{eqnarray}
  Solving these two equations for the two unknowns $i_{in}$ and $i_{sc}$, 
  we get
  \[
  i_{sc}=v_s \frac{Ar_{in}+R_1}{(1-A)R_1 r_{in} +r_{out}(r_{in}+R_1)}
  \]
  The open-circuit output voltage $v_{oc}$ is 
  \[
  v_{oc}=Ar_{in}i_{in}+R_1i_{in}=(Ar_{in}+R_1)\frac{v_s}{r_{in}+R_1} 
  \]
  Now the output resistance can be found to be:
  \begin{eqnarray}
  R_{out}&=&\frac{v_{oc}}{i_{sc}}
  =\frac{(1-A)r_{in}R_1+r_{out}(r_{in}+R_1)}{r_{in}+R_1}
  \nonumber\\
  &=&r_{out}-\frac{(A-1) r_{in}R_1}{R_1+r_{in}}
  \approx r_{out}-A\;r_{in}||R_1<r_{out}
  \nonumber
  \end{eqnarray}
  i.e., the output resistance is much reduced. Moreover, when $R_1=0$, 
  $R_{out}=r_{out}$.
  \end{comment}

  We first find the short-circuit current $i_{sc}$ 
  at the output port. Assume a voltage source $v_s$ with internal resistance 
  $R_S$ is applied to the input port while the output port is short-circuited.
  Applying KVL to the two loops of the circuit, we get:
  \[ v_s=(R_S+R_1+r_{in})i_{in}-R_1 i_{sc} \]
  \[ A v_{in}=A r_{in} i_{in}=(r_{out}+R_1) i_{sc}-R_1 i_{in} \]
  Solving these two equations for the two unknowns $i_{in}$ and $i_{sc}$, we get
  \[ 
  i_{sc}=v_s \frac{Ar_{in}+R_1}{(1-A)R_1 r_{in} +r_{out}(R_S+r_{in}+R_1)+R_SR_1} 
  \]
  The open-circuit output voltage $v_{oc}$ is 
  \[ v_{oc}=Ar_{in}i_{in}+R_1i_{in}=(Ar_{in}+R_1)\frac{v_s}{R_S+r_{in}+R_1} \]
  Now the output resistance can be found to be:
  \[ R_{out}=\frac{v_{oc}}{i_{sc}}
  =\frac{(1-A)r_{in}R_1+r_{out}(R_S+r_{in}+R_1)+R_SR_1}{R_S+r_{in}+R_1}
  =r_{out}+\frac{(1-A) r_{in}R_1 +R_SR_1}{R_1+r_{in}+R_S}\]
  Note that $R_{out}$ is affected by internal resistance $R_S$ of the source.
  When $R_S=0$, 
  \[
  R_{out}\stackrel{R_S=0}{\Longrightarrow} r_{out}-(A-1) r_{in}\,||\,R_1 < r_{out} 
  \]
  i.e., the output resistance is much reduced. Moreover, when $R_1=0$, 
  $R_{out}=r_{out}$.

\item {\bf Input resistance:} This can be found by applying an ideal voltage
  source $v_s$ to the input port, while the output port is connected to a 
  load $R_L$. The input resistance is $R_{in}=v_s/i_{in}$ where $i_{in}$ is
  the input current. Applying the KVL to the two loops of this circuit, we
  get
  \[ v_s=(r_{in}+R_1) i_{in}-R_1 i_{out} \]
  \[ A v_{in}=Ar_{in}i_{in}=(r_{out}+R_L+R_1)i_{out}-R_1i_{in} \]
  Solving these two equations for the two unknowns $i_{in}$ and $i_{out}$,
  we get
  \[ i_{in}=v_s \frac{R_1+R_L+r_{out}}{(R_L+r_{out})(R_1+r_{in})+(1-A)R_1r_{in}}
  \stackrel{R_L\rightarrow \infty}{\Longrightarrow} \frac{v_s}{r_{in}+R_1} \]
  Now the input resistance can be found to be
  \[ R_{in}=\frac{v_s}{i_{in}}=\frac{(R_L+r_{out})(R_1+r_{in})+(1-A)R_1r_{in}}{R_1+R_L+r_{out}}
  \stackrel{R_L\rightarrow \infty}{\Longrightarrow} R_1+r_{in}>r_{in} \]  
  Note that $R_{in}$ is affected by the load $R_L$. When $R_L=\infty$,
  $R_{in}=R_1+r_{in}$, i.e., the input resistance is much increased. 
  Moreover, if $R_1=0$, the circuit is reduced to the original voltage 
  amplifier with $R_{in}=r_{in}$.
\end{itemize}
In summary, the resistor $R_1$ shared by both the input and output loops
serves as a negative feedback:
\[ v_s\uparrow \rightarrow i_{in}, v_{out}\uparrow \rightarrow v_1\uparrow 
\rightarrow i_{in}, v_{out}\downarrow \]
As the result, the voltage gain $A_{oc}$ is reduced but both the input and
output resistances are improved, i.e., $R_{in}$ is increased and the $R_{out}$
is reduced.

{\bf Example 4:} (Homework)

The transistor emitter follower and the op-amp buffer shown below 
are very important circuits which find wide applications in 
practice. These two circuits can be similarly modeled based on the 
individual models of the transistor and the an op-amp (the inner
dashed boxes), also shown in the figure. Note that the two models 
are equivalent (the outter dashed boxes), as the non-ideal current 
and voltage in the models can be converted to each other.

\htmladdimg{../figures/BufferModels.png}
%\htmladdimg{../figures/voltageamplifierex5.gif}

The parameter $\beta$ of the transistor model is its current gain,
and the parameter $A$ of the op-amp model is its voltage gain, both
of them are much greater than 1. And for the op-amp, we also have
$r_{in}>>r_{out}$.

We can now find the three parameters of the model of the two circuits:

\begin{itemize}
\item The input resistance $R_{in}=V_s/i_{in}$, where $V_s$ is the source
  voltage applied across A and B, $i_{in}$ is the current through the 
  input port, when a load $R_L$ is connected to the output port between
  C and D.
\item The output resistance $R_{out}=v_{oc}/i_{sc}$, where $v_{oc}$ and
  $i_{sc}$ are the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current when
  an ideal source voltage $V_s$ (with $R_S=0$) is applied to the input 
  port.
\item The open-circuit gain $A_{oc}=V_{oc}/V_{sc}$.
\end{itemize}

Two amplifiers with parameters $A_1$, $r_{i1}$, $r_{o1}$ and $A_2$, $r_{i2}$, 
$r_{o2}$, respectively, can be connected in cascade as shown in the figure. 
Given a voltage source $v_s$ in series with an internal resistance $R_S$,
find the output voltage. To maximize the output $v_{out}$, how would you 
change the values of the six parameters?

{\bf Example 6:} (Homework)

The input and output resistances $R_{in}$ and $R_{out}$, as well as the voltage 
gain $A_{oc}$ of a two-port network can be obtained experimentally. First,
connect an ideal voltage source $v_s$ (a new battery with very low internal
resistance) in series with a resistor $R_S$, and then connect load $R_L$ of
two different resistances to the output port. Now the three parameters can
be derived from the known values of $v_s$, $R_S$ and the two measurements of
the load voltage $v_{out}$, corresponding to the two resistance values used.

Assume $v_s=1.5V$, $R_S=5 k\Omega$, and the input voltage is measured to be 
$v_{in}=1.25 V$; also, assume the two different load resistors used are 
$R_1=150 \Omega$ and $R_2=200 \Omega$ respectively, with the two corresponding
output voltage $v_1=18.75V$ and $v_2=20$. Find $R_{in}$, $R_{out}$ and $A_{oc}$.
