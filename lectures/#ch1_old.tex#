\section*{Chapter 1: Basic Quantities and Laws}

\subsection*{Basic Quantities}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Force $f$:} Force can be defined by Newton's second law: 
\[ f=ma,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;[newton]=\frac{[kilogram][meter]}{[second]^2}	\]
	The force of 1 newton will cause a mass of 1 kilogram to accelerate
	at 1 meter per second per second. 

	{\bf Comparison:}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The gravitational force between masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ is
	\[	f=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}	\]
	In particular, on surface of Earth, the ``weight'' of a mass $m$
	is
	\[	f=G\frac{Mm}{r^2}=gm	\]
	where $g=GM/r^2=9.8\;\mbox{meter}/\mbox{second}^2$ is the 
	gravitational acceleration that measures the intensity of Earth's 
	gravitational field.
	\item The electric force is
	\[	f=k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}=Eq_2	\]
	where $E=kq_1/r^2$ is the intensity of the electric field caused
	by charge $q_1$, and $f$ is the force this field asserts on charge
	$q_2$.
	\end{itemize}

\item {\bf Energy $W$: } (a conservative quantity, can be neither created 
	nor destroyed)

{\bf Potential Energy:} When an object with weight of 1 newton is raised
	by 1 meter, it receives 1 joule of potential energy.
\[	W=fl,\;\;\;\;\;\;[joule]=[newton][meter]
	=\frac{[kilogram][meter]^2}{[second]^2} \]

{\bf Kinetic Energy:} A mass of 1 kilogram moving with a velocity $u$
	of 1 meter per second possesses 1/2 joule of kinetic energy.
\[	W=mu^2/2,\;\;\;\;\;[joule]=\frac{[kilogram][meter]^2}{[second]^2} \]
	Another unit for energy is {\em calorie}:
	$ 1 \; \mbox{cal}=4.2\;\mbox{joules}	$
	
\item {\bf Power $P$:} The rate of energy transformation. The 
	transformation 1 joule of energy in 1 second represents a power
	of 1 watt. The instantaneous and average power are defined by:
\[	p=dw/dt,\;\;\;\;\;\;P=W/T\;\;\;\;\;[watt]=\frac{[joule]}{[second]}\]
	Another unit for power is {\em horse power}: 
	$1 \; \mbox{hp}=746 \; \mbox{watts} $

	Energy can also be measured by {\em kilowatt-hours (kWh)} 
	$ 1000 \times 3600=3.6 \times 10^6 $ joules.

\item {\bf Charge:} The charge of $6.24 \times 10^{18}$ electrons
	is a {\em coulomb}, i.e., the charge each electron carries 
	is $1/ (6.24 \times 10^{18})=1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ coulomb.
	Charge is conservative.

\item {\bf Current:} The rate of flow of positive charges:
\[ i=dq/dt,\;\;\;\;\; q=\int i \; dt,	\;\;\;\;\;
	[\mbox{ampere}]=\frac{[coulomb]}{[second]}	\]


\item {\bf Voltage v:} The energy required to move a unit charge $q=1$
	from one electric potential $u_1$ to another $u_2$. The difference 
	between the two potentials or voltage is $v=u_2-u_1$. When a 
	charge of 1 coulomb is moved through a voltage of 1 volt, it 
	receives or delivers an energy of 1 joule
	\[	v=dw/dq,\;\;\;\;\;[volt]=\frac{[joule]}{[coulomb]}	\]

	{\bf Comparison:}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The energy needed to move a charge $q$ from point 1 with 
	potential $u_1$ to point 2 with potential $u_2$ is 
	$w=qv=q(u_2-u_1)$, and $v=u_1-u_2$ is the potential difference 
	between the two points.
	\item The energy needed to move a mass $m$ from height $h_1$ 
	to height $h_2$ is $w=fl=mg(h_2-h_1)$, and $gl=g(h_2-h_1)
	=gh_2-gh_1$ is the potential difference between the two heights.
	\end{itemize}

\item {\bf Electric Field:} a force field defined as:
	\[	E=\frac{dv}{dl}=\frac{u_2-u_1}{l}	\]

	{\bf Comparison:} 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Electric field $E=(u_2-u_1)/l$ is the electric potential 
	difference per unit distance.
	\item Gravitational field $g=(gh_2-gh_1)/l$ is the gravitational
	potential difference per unit distance.
	\end{itemize}

	But as
	\[ E=\frac{v}{l}=\frac{w}{ql}=\frac{fl}{ql}=\frac{f}{q} \]
	we get the alternative definition of electric field
	\[	E=f/q,	\;\;\;\;\; f=q\;E \]

	{\bf Comparison:}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Electric field $E=f/q$ is electric force per unit charge.
	\item Gravitational field $g=f/m$ is gravitational force per unit
		mass.
	\end{itemize}

\htmladdimg{../figures/basicquantities.gif}

\item {\bf Electrical power and energy:}
	\[	p=\frac{dw}{dt}=\frac{dw}{dq} \; \frac{dq}{dt}=vi,
	\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
	[watt]=[volt][ampere]
	=\frac{[joule]}{[coulomb]}\frac{[coulomb]}{[second]}
	=\frac{[joule]}{[second]}	\]
	\[	w=\int p dt = \int vi dt,\;\;\;\;
	[joule]=[watt][second]=[volt][ampere][second]	\]

\item {\bf Magnetic Flux:} 
	The intensity of magnetic effect (lines per unit area in magnetic field
	or flux) is measured by magnetic flux density $B$ in tesla, and the 
	{\em magnetic flux} $\phi$ within an area is
	\[ \phi=\int B \cdot dA=|B|\;|A| cos\alpha	\]
	This is the dot product of magnetic intensity vector $B$ and area 
	vector $A$ (in the normal direction of the area), and $\alpha$ is
	the angle between the two directions. 
	
	When $B$ and $A$ are in the same direction ($\alpha=0$), and if $B$ 
	is 1 tesla and $A$ is 1 square meter, the flux $\phi$ is 1 weber.

\item {\bf Electric Magnetic Interaction:}

	In a magnetic field $\vec{B}$, a force $\vec{f}$ is exerted on a 
	charge $q$ moving with velocity $\vec{u}$:
	\[	\vec{f}=q\vec{u} \times \vec{B}	\]
	where the force vector $\vec{f}$ is the cross product of velocity 
	vector $\vec{u}$ and magnetic flux vector $\vec{B}$ (right-hand rule).

	\[ [newton]=[coulomb]\frac{[meter]}{[second]} [tesla]	\]

	A force of 1 newton is experienced by a charge of 1 coulomb moving
	with a velocity of 1 meter per second normal to a magnetic flux
	density of 1 tesla.

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Capacitor and Inductor}

{\bf Capacitor}

Conceptually a capacitor is composed of a pair of plates of conductor
which can be charged by a voltage source. The voltage between the two
plates is proportional to the charge $Q$, but inversely proportional
to the capacity $C$ of the capacitor:
\[	V=\frac{Q}{C}	\]

\htmladdimg{../figures/capacitor.gif}

\htmladdimg{../figures/capacitoranalogy1.gif}
\htmladdimg{../figures/capacitoranalogy2.gif}

{\bf Inductor}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Electromagnetic Interaction: Electricity to Magnetism}

Magnetic field (flux) is generated in the space around a current 
flowing through a piece of conductor:
\htmladdimg{../figures/coil0.gif}

The magnetic field around a coil is the superposition of the magnetic 
flux generated by each section of the coil:
\htmladdimg{../figures/coil1.gif}

\item {\bf Electromagnetic Interaction: Magnetism to Electricity}

Electric current is induced in a conductor when there is changing
magnetic flux in the surrounding space.
\htmladdimg{../figures/electromagnetic.gif}

\htmladdimg{../figures/electromagnetic1.gif}

\item {\bf Self and Mutual Induction}

A time-varying electric current in a coil will cause a time-varying 
magnetic field in the surrounding space, which in turn will induce 
electric voltage and then current in the same coil (self-induction) 
or a different coil in the neighborhood (mutual-induction).

\item {\bf Faraday's Law:} 

The self-induced voltage across the coil due to a current $i(t)$ is
proportional to the rate of change over time of the total magnetic 
flux caused by the current: 
\[ v(t)=\frac{d\Psi(t)}{dt}=N\frac{d\Phi(t)}{dt}=L\frac{di(t)}{dt} \]
Here $\Psi=N\Phi=Li$ is the total magnetic flux in the coil, and 
$L=\Psi/i$ is the inductance of the coil that represents how much
flux can be generated by the coil per unit current.

\item {\bf Lenz's Law:} 

The polarity of the self-induced voltage $v(t)$ in a coil is such 
that it tends to produce a current which induces a magnetic flux to 
oppose the change of the magnetic field that induced the voltage, 
thereby opposing any change in current $i(t)$ that is causing the 
magnetic flux. 

When current $i(t)$ increases, the induced voltage $v(t)$ tends to
resist it, when current $i(t)$ decreases, the induced voltage
$v(t)$ tends to sustain it.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Linear Elements and Experimental Laws:} 

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Resistance and Ohm's Law:} The ratio of the voltage $V$ across 
	a piece of conductor (e.g., a rod of copper) and the current $I$ 
	through it is constant:
	\[ R=\frac{V}{I},\;\;\;\;\;\;[ohm]=\frac{[volt]}{[ampere]} \]
	This formula is called the {\em Ohm's Law} and the constant ratio
	is called the {\em resistance} of the conductor measured by
	Ohm $\Omega$. (\htmladdnormallink{George Ohm (1789-1854)}{http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Ohm.html})

	The reciprocal of resistance is called {\em conductance}:
	\[ G=1/R=I/V\;\;\;\;\;\;[siemens]=\frac{1}{[ohm]}=\frac{[ampere]}{[volt]}	\]
	Conductance is measured by Siemens $S$ 
(\htmladdnormallink{Werner von Siemens (1816-1892)}{http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/~eugeniik/history/siemens.html}

%{http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?eu=69422&tocid=0&query=werner%20bischof}

\item {\bf Capacitance: } The ratio between the current through 
	a pair of conductor plates and the rate of change of the 
	voltage across it is constant:
	\[ i(t)=C\frac{dv(t)}{dt},\;\;\;\;
	v(t)=\frac{1}{C}\int_{-\infty}^t i(\tau) d\tau=\frac{q}{C},
	\;\;\;\;\;C=\frac{q}{v},\;\;\;\;\;[farad]=\frac{[coulomb]}{[volt]}	\]
	This constant is called {\em capacitance} and measured in
	{\em farads (F)} 
(\htmladdnormallink{Michael Faraday (1791-1867)}{http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Faraday.html}). Other units used for capacity
	are $\mu F=10^{-6} F$, $nF=10^{-9}F$, and $pF=10^{-12}F$.
	Comparing the above with $i(t)=G\;v(t)$, we see that the 
	``conductance'' of a capacitor is proportional to the rate of
	change of the voltage. 	

	Intuitively, capacitance represents the capacity of the device.
	Given certain charge $q$, the larger the capacitance, the 
	lower the voltage (given certain amount of water, the larger the
	container, the lower the water level thereby the lower the water
	pressure).

	When the voltage is sinusoidal $v(t)=sin(\omega t)$, 
	the current is $i(t)=C dv(t)/dt= \omega C\; cos(\omega t)$:
	\htmladdimg{../figures/capacitorIV.gif}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item The current has a 90 degree phase lead compared to the voltage
	(it takes time for the voltage across capacitor to build up);
	\item The amplitude of the current is proportional to the frequency
	of the voltage. In particular, when $\omega=0$ (DC), the current is 
	0 (open circuit), and when $\omega \rightarrow \infty$ (very high 
	frequency), the current $i(t) \rightarrow \infty$ (short circuit).
	\end{enumerate}

\item {\bf Inductance: } The ratio between the voltage across a multi-turn
	coil conductor and the rate of change of the current through it is
	constant:
	\[ v(t)=L\frac{di(t)}{dt}=\frac{d\psi}{dt},\;\;\;\;
	i(t)=\frac{1}{L}\int_{-\infty}^t v(\tau) d\tau	\]
	Here $\psi=i\;L$ is the total magnetic flux, and the constant $L$ 
	is called {\em inductance} and measured in {\em henrys (H)} 
(\htmladdnormallink{Joseph Henry (1797-1878)}{http://www.si.edu/archives//ihd/jhp/}). Other units used for inductance are $mH=10^{-3}H$ and $\mu H=10^{-6}H$.
	Comparing the above with $v(t)=R\;i(t)$, we see that the 
	``resistance'' of an inductor is proportional to the rate of change
	of the current.

	When the current is sinusoidal $i(t)=sin(\omega t)$, the voltage 
	is $v(t)=L di(t)/dt= \omega L\; cos(\omega t)$:
	\htmladdimg{../figures/inductorIV.gif}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item The current has a 90 degree phase lag compared to the voltage 
	(it takes time to overcome the counter potential of the inductor for 
	the current to flow);
	\item The amplitude of the voltage is proportional to the frequency
	of the current. In particular, when $\omega=0$ (DC), the voltage is 
	0 (short circuit), and when $\omega \rightarrow \infty$ (very high 
	frequency), the voltage $v(t) \rightarrow \infty$ (open circuit).
	\end{enumerate}

\item {\bf Ideal Transformer}

	Two coils around a common iron core form a transformer. Assume the
	primary coil has $N_1$ turns of wire and the secondary coil has $N_2$ 
	turns. The total magnetic flux $\psi$ is proportional to the number 
	of turns $\psi=N\phi$ where $\phi$ is the flux with one turn of wire.

	{\bf Faraday's Law:} The voltage across the primary coil is proportional
	to the rate of time change of the total magnetic flux: 
	\[ v_1(t)=\frac{d\psi_1}{dt}=N_1\frac{d\phi}{dt}=L\frac{di_1(t)}{dt} \]
	and the same is true for the secondary coil:
	\[ v_2(t)=\frac{d\psi_2}{dt}=N_2\frac{d\phi}{dt}=L\frac{di_2(t)}{dt} \]
	(assuming same $\phi$ for both coils), i.e. 
	\[ \frac{v_2}{v_1}=\frac{N_2}{N_1}	\]
	Ideally without power loss $P_1=P_2$, we also have:
	\[ P_1=v_1 i_1=P_2=v_2 i_2,\;\;\;\;\;
	\frac{i_1}{i_2}=\frac{v_2}{v_1}=\frac{N_2}{N_1}	\]

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Energy Dissipation/Storage in Linear Elements}

	Energy is power integrated over time:
	\[	w=\int_0^T p(t)\; dt=\int_0^T v(t)\; i(t) dt	\]
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Energy Dissipation:} For a resistor with $v(t)=R\;i(t)$ and
	$ i(t)=v(t)/R$, the energy dissipated in time period 
	$(0 \sim T)$ is:
	\[	w=\int_0^T v(t)\; i(t) dt=\frac{1}{R}\;\int_0^T v^2(t)\; dt
	=R\;\int_0^T i^2(t)\; dt \]
	This energy is converted irreversibly from electrical energy to heat
	in an (this heat cannot be converted back to electrical energy). The
	rate of dissipation is:
	\[ p=\frac{d}{dt} w=\frac{v^2(t)}{R}=i^2(t)R	\]

	When the current and voltage are both constant $i(t)=I$ and $v(t)=V$,
	we have $w=V^2T/R=I^2RT$. 

	{\bf Example:} When $v(t)=sin(\omega t)$ and 
	$i(t)=v(t)/R=sin(\omega t)/R$, the energy dissipated in time period
	$T=2\pi/\omega$ is
\[	w=\frac{1}{R}\int_0^T v^2(t) dt=\frac{1}{R}\int_0^T sin^2(\omega t) dt
	=\frac{1}{2R}\int_0^T (1-cos (2\omega t)) dt=\frac{T}{2R}	\]

\htmladdimg{../figures/dissipation.gif}

\item {\bf Energy Storage:} 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Capacitor}
	\[	w=\int_0^T v(t)\; i(t) dt=\int_0^T v(t) C \frac{dv(t)}{dt} dt
	=C \int_0^V v dv=\frac{1}{2}CV^2	\]
	Here we have assumed $v(0)=0$ and $v(T)=V$. We see that capacitance
	$C$ is a measure of the capacitor's ability to store energy in electric
	field (separated charge in terms of voltage V).

	{\bf Example:} When $v(t)=sin(\omega t)$, 
	$i(t)=C\;dv(t)/dt=C\omega\;cos(\omega t)$, the energy dissipated in
	time period $T=2\pi/\omega$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
w &=& \int_0^T v(t) i(t) dt=C\omega \int_0^T sin(\omega t) cos(\omega t) dt
	=\frac{C\omega}{2} \int_0^T sin(2\omega t) dt
	\nonumber \\
	&=& -\frac{C}{4} cos(2\omega t)|_0^T=0	
	\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
	This results indicates that there is no energy dissipated in period $T$, 
	because in the first and third $T/4$ the energy is stored in the capacitor
	(positive), but in the 2nd and 4th $T/4$ the energy is released from the 
	capacitor again (negative).

	\item {\bf Inductor}
	\[	w=\int_0^T v(t)\; i(t) dt=\int_0^T i(t) L \frac{di(t)}{dt} dt
	=L \int_0^I i di=\frac{1}{2}LI^2	\]
	where we have assumed $i(0)=0$ and $i(T)=I$. We see that inductance
	$L$ is a measure of the inductor's ability to store energy in magnetic 
	field (moving charge in terms of current I).

	In both of the cases of capacitor and inductor, instead of being
	dissipated (transformed to head), the energy is converted into 
	potential energy and stored in either the electric or magnetic field
	of the element.

\htmladdimg{../figures/storage.gif}

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

{\bf Comparison with mechanical systems:}

The work of a mechanical system does is $w=\int_0^X f(x)\; dx$ where $f(x)$ 
is force and $X$ is displacement.
\begin{itemize}		
\item {\bf Potential energy:} A spring can be described by Hooke's law $f=Kx$
	where $K$ is the {\em stiffness}, or $x=Cf$ where $C=1/K$ is the 
	{\em compliance}. The potential energy stored in the spring is:
	\[ w=\int_0^X f(x)\;dx=\int_0^F f\;C\;df=\frac{1}{2}CF^2	\]	
	i.e., the compliance $C$ is a measure of the spring's ability to 
	store potential energy (the less stiff, the more potential energy can
	be stored in the spring with the same force).
\item {\bf Kinetic energy:} A mass moving at a velocity $v=dx/dt$ has kinetic
	energy
\[ w=\int_0^X f(x)\;dx=\int_0^T f(t)\;\frac{dx}{dt} dt=\int_0^T f(t)\;v\;dt	\]
	But as $f=Ma=M\;dv/dt$, the kinetic energy becomes:
\[ w=\int_0^T f(t)\;v\;dt=\int_0^T M \frac{dv}{dt}\;v\;dt=M \int_0^V v\;dv
	=\frac{1}{2}MV^2 \]
	i.e., the mass $M$ of a body is a measure of the body's ability to 
	store kinetic energy (the more mass, the more kinetic energy can be 
	stored in the body with the same velocity).
\end{itemize}		

{\bf Examples:}

\begin{itemize}
\item A mechanical system composed of a spring $K$ and a mass $M$ can be
	described by:
	\[ M\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+Kx=0,\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;
		\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\frac{K}{M}x=0	\]
	where $x$ is the horizontal displacement of the mass. The 
	homogeneous solution of the differential equation can be found to be
\[	x(t)=sin(\omega t),\;\;\;\;\dot{x}(t)=\omega\;cos(\omega t),
	\;\;\;\;\ddot{x}(t)=-\omega^2\;sin(\omega t),
	\;\;\;\;\omega=\sqrt{K/M}=1/\sqrt{CM}	\]
	where $C=1/K$ is the compliance. When the displacement is zero 
	$x(t)=sin(\omega t)=0$, the velocity 
	$\dot{x}(t)=\omega\;cos(\omega t)=\pm \omega$ is maximal. This 
	corresponds to the fact that when the potential energy stored in 
	the spring is zero, the kinetic energy is maximal. On the other hand, 
	when the displacement is maximal $x(t)=sin(\omega t)=\pm 1$, the 
	velocity $\dot{x}(t)=\omega\;cos(\omega t)=0$ is zero. This corresponds
	to the fact that when the potential energy stored in the spring is
	maximal, the kinetic energy is zero.

\item An electrical system composed of a capacitor $C$ and an inductor $L$
	can be described by:
	\[	i_C=C\frac{dv}{dt},\;\;\;v=L\frac{di_L}{dt}	\]
	where $v$ is the voltage across both components, and $i_C$ and $i_L$
	are currents through $C$ and $L$, respectively. As $i_C+i_L=0$, 
	i.e. $i_C=-i_L$, we have
	\[ v=L\frac{di_L}{dt}=L\frac{d}{dt}\;(-C\frac{dv}{dt}),\;\;\;
	\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;\frac{d^2v}{dt^2}+\frac{1}{LC}v=0	\]
	The homogeneous solution of the differential equation can be found to be
\[	v(t)=sin(\omega t),\;\;\;\;\dot{v}(t)=\omega\;cos(\omega t),
	\;\;\;\;\ddot{v}(t)=-\omega^2\;sin(\omega t),
	\;\;\;\;\omega=1/\sqrt{LC}	\]
	When the energy stored in the capacitor is zero $v(t)=sin(\omega t)=0$, 
	the energy stored in the inductor is maximal $i(t)=C\dot{v}(t)=\omega 
	C\;cos(\omega t)=\pm \omega C$; but when the energy stored in the 
	capacitor is maximal $v(t)=sin(\omega t)=\pm 1$, the energy stored 
	in the inductor is zero $i(t)=C\dot{v}(t)=\omega C\;cos(\omega t)=0$.
\end{itemize}

In both cases, the energy in the system is converted back and forth 
between different forms (potential vs. kinetic, electrical vs. magnetic),
while the total amount is always reserved. 

However, when a dash-pot (causing friction proportional to speed $\dot{x}$)
is added (in parallel to the spring) in the mechanical system, and a 
resistor is added in series to the electrical circuit, the energy is 
dissipated (converted to heat) in both systems:

\[	\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\frac{b}{m}\frac{dx}{dt}+\frac{k}{m}x=0	\]
\[	\frac{d^2v}{dt^2}+\frac{R}{L}\frac{dv}{dt}+\frac{1}{LC}v=0	\]

The corresponding solution of the DEs will be decaying sinusoidal,
indicating the dissipation of the energy in the system.

\subsection*{Kirchhoff's Laws}

{\bf Terminologies in electric circuits:}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf branch:} a path containing one or more elements in series
	and connecting two nodes;
\item {\bf node:} a point where three or more current-carrying elements 
	(branches) are connected;
\item {\bf loop:} a closed path progressing from node to node and 
	returning to the starting node.
\end{itemize}
Conventionally, constant variables are represented in up-case letters
(e.g., DC voltage $V$ and current $I$, etc.), and time-varying variables
are represented in low-case letters (e.g., AC voltage $v(t)$ and current
$i(t)$).

{\bf Kirchhoff Laws}

Based on the principle of conservation of electric charge, the 
{\bf Kirchhoff current Law (KCL)} states that:

The algebraic sum of the currents into a node at any instant is zero.
	\[ \sum_k I_k=0	\]

Based on the principle of conservation of energy, the{\bf Kirchhoff 
voltage Law (KVL)} states that:

The algebraic sum of the voltages around a loop at any instant is zero.
	\[ \sum_k V_k=0	\]

\htmladdimg{../figures/Kirchhoff.gif}

{\bf Resistors in series:} According to KVL, the sum of voltages across 
the resistors is equal to the input voltage:
\[	V=V_1+V_2+\cdots+V_n=I(R_1+R_2+\cdots+R_n)=IR	\]
i.e.,
\[	R=\frac{V}{I}=R_1+R_2+\cdots+R_n	\]

\htmladdimg{../figures/resistorseries.gif}

{\bf Voltage Divider:} From the voltage divider circuit, we see the output 
as the voltage across $R_2$ is
\[	V_2=R_2 I =R_2 \frac{V}{R_1+R_2}=V\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}	\]

{\bf Resistors in parallel:} According to KCL, the sum of currents through 
the resistors is equal to the input current:
\[	I=V/R_1+V/R_2+\cdots+V/R_n=V(1/R_1+1/R_2+\cdots+1/R_n)
	=V/R	\]
i.e.,
\[ R=\frac{V}{I}=\frac{1}{1/R_1+1/R_2+\cdots+1/R_n}=R_1//R_2//\cdots//R_n \]

In particular, when $n=2$, 
\[	R=\frac{1}{1/R_1+1/R_2}=\frac{R_1\;R_2}{R_1+R_2}	\]

{\bf Current Divider:} From the current divider circuit, we see the output 
as the current through $R_2$ is
\[	I_2=\frac{V}{R_2}=\frac{IR}{R_2}=I\frac{R_1R_2/(R_1+R_2)}{R_2}
	=I\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}	\]

\htmladdimg{../figures/resistorparallel.gif}

{\bf Inductors in series:} According to KVL, the sum of voltages across 
the inductors is equal to the input voltage:
\[	v=v_1+v_2+\cdots+v_n
	=L_1\frac{di}{dt}+\cdots+L_n\frac{di}{dt}
	=(L_1+L_2+\cdots+L_n)\frac{di}{dt}
	=L\frac{di}{dt}	\]
i.e.,
\[	L=L_1+L_2+\cdots+L_n	\]

{\bf Inductors in parallel:} According to KCL, the sum of currents through 
the inductors is equal to the input current:
\[	i=i_1+i_2+\cdots+i_n
	=\frac{1}{L_1}\int v\; dt+\cdots+\frac{1}{L_n}\int v\; dt 
	=(\frac{1}{L_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{L_n})\int v\; dt
	=\frac{1}{L}\int v\; dt	 \]
we get
\[	\frac{1}{L}=\frac{1}{L_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{L_n},\;\;\;
	\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;
L=\frac{1}{1/L_1+1/L_2+\cdots+1/L_n}=L_1//L_2//\cdots//L_n \]

{\bf Capacitors in parallel:} According to KCL, the sum of currents through 
the resistors is equal to the input current:
\[	i=i_1+i_2+\cdots+i_n=C_1\frac{dv}{dt}+\cdots+C_n\frac{dv}{dt}
	=(C_1+C_2+\cdots+C_n)\frac{dv}{dt}
	=C\frac{dv}{dt}		\]
i.e.,
\[	C=C_1+C_2+\cdots+C_n	\]

{\bf Capacitors in series:} According to KVL, the sum of voltages across 
the capacitors is equal to the input voltage:
\[	v=v_1+v_2+\cdots+v_n
	=\frac{1}{C_1}\int i\;dt+\cdots+\frac{1}{C_n}\int i\;dt 
	=(\frac{1}{C_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{C_n})\int i\;dt
	=\frac{1}{C}\int i\;dt 	\]
i.e.,
\[	\frac{1}{C}=\frac{1}{C_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{C_n},
	\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;C=\frac{1}{1/C_1+1/C_2+\cdots+1/C_n}	\]

\section*{Chapter 1: Basic Quantities and Laws}

\subsection*{Basic Quantities}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Force $f$:} Force can be defined by Newton's second law: 
\[ f=ma,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;[newton]=\frac{[kilogram][meter]}{[second]^2}	\]
	The force of 1 newton will cause a mass of 1 kilogram to accelerate
	at 1 meter per second per second. 

	{\bf Comparison:}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The gravitational force between masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ is
	\[	f=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}	\]
	In particular, on surface of Earth, the ``weight'' of a mass $m$
	is
	\[	f=G\frac{Mm}{r^2}=gm	\]
	where $g=GM/r^2=9.8\;\mbox{meter}/\mbox{second}^2$ is the 
	gravitational acceleration that measures the intensity of Earth's 
	gravitational field.
	\item The electric force is
	\[	f=k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}=Eq_2	\]
	where $E=kq_1/r^2$ is the intensity of the electric field caused
	by charge $q_1$, and $f$ is the force this field asserts on charge
	$q_2$.
	\end{itemize}

\item {\bf Energy $W$: } (a conservative quantity, can be neither created 
	nor destroyed)

{\bf Potential Energy:} When an object with weight of 1 newton is raised
	by 1 meter, it receives 1 joule of potential energy.
\[	W=fl,\;\;\;\;\;\;[joule]=[newton][meter]
	=\frac{[kilogram][meter]^2}{[second]^2} \]

{\bf Kinetic Energy:} A mass of 1 kilogram moving with a velocity $u$
	of 1 meter per second possesses 1/2 joule of kinetic energy.
\[	W=mu^2/2,\;\;\;\;\;[joule]=\frac{[kilogram][meter]^2}{[second]^2} \]
	Another unit for energy is {\em calorie}:
	$ 1 \; \mbox{cal}=4.2\;\mbox{joules}	$
	
\item {\bf Power $P$:} The rate of energy transformation. The 
	transformation 1 joule of energy in 1 second represents a power
	of 1 watt. The instantaneous and average power are defined by:
\[	p=dw/dt,\;\;\;\;\;\;P=W/T\;\;\;\;\;[watt]=\frac{[joule]}{[second]}\]
	Another unit for power is {\em horse power}: 
	$1 \; \mbox{hp}=746 \; \mbox{watts} $

	Energy can also be measured by {\em kilowatt-hours (kWh)} 
	$ 1000 \times 3600=3.6 \times 10^6 $ joules.

\item {\bf Charge:} The charge of $6.24 \times 10^{18}$ electrons
	is a {\em coulomb}, i.e., the charge each electron carries 
	is $1/ (6.24 \times 10^{18})=1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ coulomb.
	Charge is conservative.

\item {\bf Current:} The rate of flow of positive charges:
\[ i=dq/dt,\;\;\;\;\; q=\int i \; dt,	\;\;\;\;\;
	[\mbox{ampere}]=\frac{[coulomb]}{[second]}	\]


\item {\bf Voltage v:} The energy required to move a unit charge $q=1$
	from one electric potential $u_1$ to another $u_2$. The difference 
	between the two potentials or voltage is $v=u_2-u_1$. When a 
	charge of 1 coulomb is moved through a voltage of 1 volt, it 
	receives or delivers an energy of 1 joule
	\[	v=dw/dq,\;\;\;\;\;[volt]=\frac{[joule]}{[coulomb]}	\]

	{\bf Comparison:}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The energy needed to move a charge $q$ from point 1 with 
	potential $u_1$ to point 2 with potential $u_2$ is 
	$w=qv=q(u_2-u_1)$, and $v=u_1-u_2$ is the potential difference 
	between the two points.
	\item The energy needed to move a mass $m$ from height $h_1$ 
	to height $h_2$ is $w=fl=mg(h_2-h_1)$, and $gl=g(h_2-h_1)
	=gh_2-gh_1$ is the potential difference between the two heights.
	\end{itemize}

\item {\bf Electric Field:} a force field defined as:
	\[	E=\frac{dv}{dl}=\frac{u_2-u_1}{l}	\]

	{\bf Comparison:} 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Electric field $E=(u_2-u_1)/l$ is the electric potential 
	difference per unit distance.
	\item Gravitational field $g=(gh_2-gh_1)/l$ is the gravitational
	potential difference per unit distance.
	\end{itemize}

	But as
	\[ E=\frac{v}{l}=\frac{w}{ql}=\frac{fl}{ql}=\frac{f}{q} \]
	we get the alternative definition of electric field
	\[	E=f/q,	\;\;\;\;\; f=q\;E \]

	{\bf Comparison:}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Electric field $E=f/q$ is electric force per unit charge.
	\item Gravitational field $g=f/m$ is gravitational force per unit
		mass.
	\end{itemize}

\htmladdimg{../figures/basicquantities.gif}

\item {\bf Electrical power and energy:}
	\[	p=\frac{dw}{dt}=\frac{dw}{dq} \; \frac{dq}{dt}=vi,
	\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
	[watt]=[volt][ampere]
	=\frac{[joule]}{[coulomb]}\frac{[coulomb]}{[second]}
	=\frac{[joule]}{[second]}	\]
	\[	w=\int p dt = \int vi dt,\;\;\;\;
	[joule]=[watt][second]=[volt][ampere][second]	\]

\item {\bf Magnetic Flux:} 
	The intensity of magnetic effect (lines per unit area in magnetic field
	or flux) is measured by magnetic flux density $B$ in tesla, and the 
	{\em magnetic flux} $\phi$ within an area is
	\[ \phi=\int B \cdot dA=|B|\;|A| cos\alpha	\]
	This is the dot product of magnetic intensity vector $B$ and area 
	vector $A$ (in the normal direction of the area), and $\alpha$ is
	the angle between the two directions. 
	
	When $B$ and $A$ are in the same direction ($\alpha=0$), and if $B$ 
	is 1 tesla and $A$ is 1 square meter, the flux $\phi$ is 1 weber.

\item {\bf Electric Magnetic Interaction:}

	In a magnetic field $\vec{B}$, a force $\vec{f}$ is exerted on a 
	charge $q$ moving with velocity $\vec{u}$:
	\[	\vec{f}=q\vec{u} \times \vec{B}	\]
	where the force vector $\vec{f}$ is the cross product of velocity 
	vector $\vec{u}$ and magnetic flux vector $\vec{B}$ (right-hand rule).

	\[ [newton]=[coulomb]\frac{[meter]}{[second]} [tesla]	\]

	A force of 1 newton is experienced by a charge of 1 coulomb moving
	with a velocity of 1 meter per second normal to a magnetic flux
	density of 1 tesla.

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Capacitor and Inductor}

{\bf Capacitor}

Conceptually a capacitor is composed of a pair of plates of conductor
which can be charged by a voltage source. The voltage between the two
plates is proportional to the charge $Q$, but inversely proportional
to the capacity $C$ of the capacitor:
\[	V=\frac{Q}{C}	\]

\htmladdimg{../figures/capacitor.gif}

\htmladdimg{../figures/capacitoranalogy1.gif}
\htmladdimg{../figures/capacitoranalogy2.gif}

{\bf Inductor}

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Electromagnetic Interaction: Electricity to Magnetism}

Magnetic field (flux) is generated in the space around a current 
flowing through a piece of conductor:
\htmladdimg{../figures/coil0.gif}

The magnetic field around a coil is the superposition of the magnetic 
flux generated by each section of the coil:
\htmladdimg{../figures/coil1.gif}

\item {\bf Electromagnetic Interaction: Magnetism to Electricity}

Electric current is induced in a conductor when there is changing
magnetic flux in the surrounding space.
\htmladdimg{../figures/electromagnetic.gif}

\htmladdimg{../figures/electromagnetic1.gif}

\item {\bf Self and Mutual Induction}

A time-varying electric current in a coil will cause a time-varying 
magnetic field in the surrounding space, which in turn will induce 
electric voltage and then current in the same coil (self-induction) 
or a different coil in the neighborhood (mutual-induction).

\item {\bf Faraday's Law:} 

The self-induced voltage across the coil due to a current $i(t)$ is
proportional to the rate of change over time of the total magnetic 
flux caused by the current: 
\[ v(t)=\frac{d\Psi(t)}{dt}=N\frac{d\Phi(t)}{dt}=L\frac{di(t)}{dt} \]
Here $\Psi=N\Phi=Li$ is the total magnetic flux in the coil, and 
$L=\Psi/i$ is the inductance of the coil that represents how much
flux can be generated by the coil per unit current.

\item {\bf Lenz's Law:} 

The polarity of the self-induced voltage $v(t)$ in a coil is such 
that it tends to produce a current which induces a magnetic flux to 
oppose the change of the magnetic field that induced the voltage, 
thereby opposing any change in current $i(t)$ that is causing the 
magnetic flux. 

When current $i(t)$ increases, the induced voltage $v(t)$ tends to
resist it, when current $i(t)$ decreases, the induced voltage
$v(t)$ tends to sustain it.

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Linear Elements and Experimental Laws:} 

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Resistance and Ohm's Law:} The ratio of the voltage $V$ across 
	a piece of conductor (e.g., a rod of copper) and the current $I$ 
	through it is constant:
	\[ R=\frac{V}{I},\;\;\;\;\;\;[ohm]=\frac{[volt]}{[ampere]} \]
	This formula is called the {\em Ohm's Law} and the constant ratio
	is called the {\em resistance} of the conductor measured by
	Ohm $\Omega$. (\htmladdnormallink{George Ohm (1789-1854)}{http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Ohm.html})

	The reciprocal of resistance is called {\em conductance}:
	\[ G=1/R=I/V\;\;\;\;\;\;[siemens]=\frac{1}{[ohm]}=\frac{[ampere]}{[volt]}	\]
	Conductance is measured by Siemens $S$ 
(\htmladdnormallink{Werner von Siemens (1816-1892)}{http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/~eugeniik/history/siemens.html}

%{http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?eu=69422&tocid=0&query=werner%20bischof}

\item {\bf Capacitance: } The ratio between the current through 
	a pair of conductor plates and the rate of change of the 
	voltage across it is constant:
	\[ i(t)=C\frac{dv(t)}{dt},\;\;\;\;
	v(t)=\frac{1}{C}\int_{-\infty}^t i(\tau) d\tau=\frac{q}{C},
	\;\;\;\;\;C=\frac{q}{v},\;\;\;\;\;[farad]=\frac{[coulomb]}{[volt]}	\]
	This constant is called {\em capacitance} and measured in
	{\em farads (F)} 
(\htmladdnormallink{Michael Faraday (1791-1867)}{http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Faraday.html}). Other units used for capacity
	are $\mu F=10^{-6} F$, $nF=10^{-9}F$, and $pF=10^{-12}F$.
	Comparing the above with $i(t)=G\;v(t)$, we see that the 
	``conductance'' of a capacitor is proportional to the rate of
	change of the voltage. 	

	Intuitively, capacitance represents the capacity of the device.
	Given certain charge $q$, the larger the capacitance, the 
	lower the voltage (given certain amount of water, the larger the
	container, the lower the water level thereby the lower the water
	pressure).

	When the voltage is sinusoidal $v(t)=sin(\omega t)$, 
	the current is $i(t)=C dv(t)/dt= \omega C\; cos(\omega t)$:
	\htmladdimg{../figures/capacitorIV.gif}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item The current has a 90 degree phase lead compared to the voltage
	(it takes time for the voltage across capacitor to build up);
	\item The amplitude of the current is proportional to the frequency
	of the voltage. In particular, when $\omega=0$ (DC), the current is 
	0 (open circuit), and when $\omega \rightarrow \infty$ (very high 
	frequency), the current $i(t) \rightarrow \infty$ (short circuit).
	\end{enumerate}

\item {\bf Inductance: } The ratio between the voltage across a multi-turn
	coil conductor and the rate of change of the current through it is
	constant:
	\[ v(t)=L\frac{di(t)}{dt}=\frac{d\psi}{dt},\;\;\;\;
	i(t)=\frac{1}{L}\int_{-\infty}^t v(\tau) d\tau	\]
	Here $\psi=i\;L$ is the total magnetic flux, and the constant $L$ 
	is called {\em inductance} and measured in {\em henrys (H)} 
(\htmladdnormallink{Joseph Henry (1797-1878)}{http://www.si.edu/archives//ihd/jhp/}). Other units used for inductance are $mH=10^{-3}H$ and $\mu H=10^{-6}H$.
	Comparing the above with $v(t)=R\;i(t)$, we see that the 
	``resistance'' of an inductor is proportional to the rate of change
	of the current.

	When the current is sinusoidal $i(t)=sin(\omega t)$, the voltage 
	is $v(t)=L di(t)/dt= \omega L\; cos(\omega t)$:
	\htmladdimg{../figures/inductorIV.gif}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item The current has a 90 degree phase lag compared to the voltage 
	(it takes time to overcome the counter potential of the inductor for 
	the current to flow);
	\item The amplitude of the voltage is proportional to the frequency
	of the current. In particular, when $\omega=0$ (DC), the voltage is 
	0 (short circuit), and when $\omega \rightarrow \infty$ (very high 
	frequency), the voltage $v(t) \rightarrow \infty$ (open circuit).
	\end{enumerate}

\item {\bf Ideal Transformer}

	Two coils around a common iron core form a transformer. Assume the
	primary coil has $N_1$ turns of wire and the secondary coil has $N_2$ 
	turns. The total magnetic flux $\psi$ is proportional to the number 
	of turns $\psi=N\phi$ where $\phi$ is the flux with one turn of wire.

	{\bf Faraday's Law:} The voltage across the primary coil is proportional
	to the rate of time change of the total magnetic flux: 
	\[ v_1(t)=\frac{d\psi_1}{dt}=N_1\frac{d\phi}{dt}=L\frac{di_1(t)}{dt} \]
	and the same is true for the secondary coil:
	\[ v_2(t)=\frac{d\psi_2}{dt}=N_2\frac{d\phi}{dt}=L\frac{di_2(t)}{dt} \]
	(assuming same $\phi$ for both coils), i.e. 
	\[ \frac{v_2}{v_1}=\frac{N_2}{N_1}	\]
	Ideally without power loss $P_1=P_2$, we also have:
	\[ P_1=v_1 i_1=P_2=v_2 i_2,\;\;\;\;\;
	\frac{i_1}{i_2}=\frac{v_2}{v_1}=\frac{N_2}{N_1}	\]

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Energy Dissipation/Storage in Linear Elements}

	Energy is power integrated over time:
	\[	w=\int_0^T p(t)\; dt=\int_0^T v(t)\; i(t) dt	\]
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Energy Dissipation:} For a resistor with $v(t)=R\;i(t)$ and
	$ i(t)=v(t)/R$, the energy dissipated in time period 
	$(0 \sim T)$ is:
	\[	w=\int_0^T v(t)\; i(t) dt=\frac{1}{R}\;\int_0^T v^2(t)\; dt
	=R\;\int_0^T i^2(t)\; dt \]
	This energy is converted irreversibly from electrical energy to heat
	in an (this heat cannot be converted back to electrical energy). The
	rate of dissipation is:
	\[ p=\frac{d}{dt} w=\frac{v^2(t)}{R}=i^2(t)R	\]

	When the current and voltage are both constant $i(t)=I$ and $v(t)=V$,
	we have $w=V^2T/R=I^2RT$. 

	{\bf Example:} When $v(t)=sin(\omega t)$ and 
	$i(t)=v(t)/R=sin(\omega t)/R$, the energy dissipated in time period
	$T=2\pi/\omega$ is
\[	w=\frac{1}{R}\int_0^T v^2(t) dt=\frac{1}{R}\int_0^T sin^2(\omega t) dt
	=\frac{1}{2R}\int_0^T (1-cos (2\omega t)) dt=\frac{T}{2R}	\]

\htmladdimg{../figures/dissipation.gif}

\item {\bf Energy Storage:} 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Capacitor}
	\[	w=\int_0^T v(t)\; i(t) dt=\int_0^T v(t) C \frac{dv(t)}{dt} dt
	=C \int_0^V v dv=\frac{1}{2}CV^2	\]
	Here we have assumed $v(0)=0$ and $v(T)=V$. We see that capacitance
	$C$ is a measure of the capacitor's ability to store energy in electric
	field (separated charge in terms of voltage V).

	{\bf Example:} When $v(t)=sin(\omega t)$, 
	$i(t)=C\;dv(t)/dt=C\omega\;cos(\omega t)$, the energy dissipated in
	time period $T=2\pi/\omega$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
w &=& \int_0^T v(t) i(t) dt=C\omega \int_0^T sin(\omega t) cos(\omega t) dt
	=\frac{C\omega}{2} \int_0^T sin(2\omega t) dt
	\nonumber \\
	&=& -\frac{C}{4} cos(2\omega t)|_0^T=0	
	\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
	This results indicates that there is no energy dissipated in period $T$, 
	because in the first and third $T/4$ the energy is stored in the capacitor
	(positive), but in the 2nd and 4th $T/4$ the energy is released from the 
	capacitor again (negative).

	\item {\bf Inductor}
	\[	w=\int_0^T v(t)\; i(t) dt=\int_0^T i(t) L \frac{di(t)}{dt} dt
	=L \int_0^I i di=\frac{1}{2}LI^2	\]
	where we have assumed $i(0)=0$ and $i(T)=I$. We see that inductance
	$L$ is a measure of the inductor's ability to store energy in magnetic 
	field (moving charge in terms of current I).

	In both of the cases of capacitor and inductor, instead of being
	dissipated (transformed to head), the energy is converted into 
	potential energy and stored in either the electric or magnetic field
	of the element.

\htmladdimg{../figures/storage.gif}

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

{\bf Comparison with mechanical systems:}

The work of a mechanical system does is $w=\int_0^X f(x)\; dx$ where $f(x)$ 
is force and $X$ is displacement.
\begin{itemize}		
\item {\bf Potential energy:} A spring can be described by Hooke's law $f=Kx$
	where $K$ is the {\em stiffness}, or $x=Cf$ where $C=1/K$ is the 
	{\em compliance}. The potential energy stored in the spring is:
	\[ w=\int_0^X f(x)\;dx=\int_0^F f\;C\;df=\frac{1}{2}CF^2	\]	
	i.e., the compliance $C$ is a measure of the spring's ability to 
	store potential energy (the less stiff, the more potential energy can
	be stored in the spring with the same force).
\item {\bf Kinetic energy:} A mass moving at a velocity $v=dx/dt$ has kinetic
	energy
\[ w=\int_0^X f(x)\;dx=\int_0^T f(t)\;\frac{dx}{dt} dt=\int_0^T f(t)\;v\;dt	\]
	But as $f=Ma=M\;dv/dt$, the kinetic energy becomes:
\[ w=\int_0^T f(t)\;v\;dt=\int_0^T M \frac{dv}{dt}\;v\;dt=M \int_0^V v\;dv
	=\frac{1}{2}MV^2 \]
	i.e., the mass $M$ of a body is a measure of the body's ability to 
	store kinetic energy (the more mass, the more kinetic energy can be 
	stored in the body with the same velocity).
\end{itemize}		

{\bf Examples:}

\begin{itemize}
\item A mechanical system composed of a spring $K$ and a mass $M$ can be
	described by:
	\[ M\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+Kx=0,\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;
		\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\frac{K}{M}x=0	\]
	where $x$ is the horizontal displacement of the mass. The 
	homogeneous solution of the differential equation can be found to be
\[	x(t)=sin(\omega t),\;\;\;\;\dot{x}(t)=\omega\;cos(\omega t),
	\;\;\;\;\ddot{x}(t)=-\omega^2\;sin(\omega t),
	\;\;\;\;\omega=\sqrt{K/M}=1/\sqrt{CM}	\]
	where $C=1/K$ is the compliance. When the displacement is zero 
	$x(t)=sin(\omega t)=0$, the velocity 
	$\dot{x}(t)=\omega\;cos(\omega t)=\pm \omega$ is maximal. This 
	corresponds to the fact that when the potential energy stored in 
	the spring is zero, the kinetic energy is maximal. On the other hand, 
	when the displacement is maximal $x(t)=sin(\omega t)=\pm 1$, the 
	velocity $\dot{x}(t)=\omega\;cos(\omega t)=0$ is zero. This corresponds
	to the fact that when the potential energy stored in the spring is
	maximal, the kinetic energy is zero.

\item An electrical system composed of a capacitor $C$ and an inductor $L$
	can be described by:
	\[	i_C=C\frac{dv}{dt},\;\;\;v=L\frac{di_L}{dt}	\]
	where $v$ is the voltage across both components, and $i_C$ and $i_L$
	are currents through $C$ and $L$, respectively. As $i_C+i_L=0$, 
	i.e. $i_C=-i_L$, we have
	\[ v=L\frac{di_L}{dt}=L\frac{d}{dt}\;(-C\frac{dv}{dt}),\;\;\;
	\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;\frac{d^2v}{dt^2}+\frac{1}{LC}v=0	\]
	The homogeneous solution of the differential equation can be found to be
\[	v(t)=sin(\omega t),\;\;\;\;\dot{v}(t)=\omega\;cos(\omega t),
	\;\;\;\;\ddot{v}(t)=-\omega^2\;sin(\omega t),
	\;\;\;\;\omega=1/\sqrt{LC}	\]
	When the energy stored in the capacitor is zero $v(t)=sin(\omega t)=0$, 
	the energy stored in the inductor is maximal $i(t)=C\dot{v}(t)=\omega 
	C\;cos(\omega t)=\pm \omega C$; but when the energy stored in the 
	capacitor is maximal $v(t)=sin(\omega t)=\pm 1$, the energy stored 
	in the inductor is zero $i(t)=C\dot{v}(t)=\omega C\;cos(\omega t)=0$.
\end{itemize}

In both cases, the energy in the system is converted back and forth 
between different forms (potential vs. kinetic, electrical vs. magnetic),
while the total amount is always reserved. 

However, when a dash-pot (causing friction proportional to speed $\dot{x}$)
is added (in parallel to the spring) in the mechanical system, and a 
resistor is added in series to the electrical circuit, the energy is 
dissipated (converted to heat) in both systems:

\[	\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}+\frac{b}{m}\frac{dx}{dt}+\frac{k}{m}x=0	\]
\[	\frac{d^2v}{dt^2}+\frac{R}{L}\frac{dv}{dt}+\frac{1}{LC}v=0	\]

The corresponding solution of the DEs will be decaying sinusoidal,
indicating the dissipation of the energy in the system.

\subsection*{Kirchhoff's Laws}

{\bf Terminologies in electric circuits:}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf branch:} a path containing one or more elements in series
	and connecting two nodes;
\item {\bf node:} a point where three or more current-carrying elements 
	(branches) are connected;
\item {\bf loop:} a closed path progressing from node to node and 
	returning to the starting node.
\end{itemize}
Conventionally, constant variables are represented in up-case letters
(e.g., DC voltage $V$ and current $I$, etc.), and time-varying variables
are represented in low-case letters (e.g., AC voltage $v(t)$ and current
$i(t)$).

{\bf Kirchhoff Laws}

Based on the principle of conservation of electric charge, the 
{\bf Kirchhoff current Law (KCL)} states that:

The algebraic sum of the currents into a node at any instant is zero.
	\[ \sum_k I_k=0	\]

Based on the principle of conservation of energy, the{\bf Kirchhoff 
voltage Law (KVL)} states that:

The algebraic sum of the voltages around a loop at any instant is zero.
	\[ \sum_k V_k=0	\]

\htmladdimg{../figures/Kirchhoff.gif}

{\bf Resistors in series:} According to KVL, the sum of voltages across 
the resistors is equal to the input voltage:
\[	V=V_1+V_2+\cdots+V_n=I(R_1+R_2+\cdots+R_n)=IR	\]
i.e.,
\[	R=\frac{V}{I}=R_1+R_2+\cdots+R_n	\]

\htmladdimg{../figures/resistorseries.gif}

{\bf Voltage Divider:} From the voltage divider circuit, we see the output 
as the voltage across $R_2$ is
\[	V_2=R_2 I =R_2 \frac{V}{R_1+R_2}=V\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}	\]

{\bf Resistors in parallel:} According to KCL, the sum of currents through 
the resistors is equal to the input current:
\[	I=V/R_1+V/R_2+\cdots+V/R_n=V(1/R_1+1/R_2+\cdots+1/R_n)
	=V/R	\]
i.e.,
\[ R=\frac{V}{I}=\frac{1}{1/R_1+1/R_2+\cdots+1/R_n}=R_1//R_2//\cdots//R_n \]

In particular, when $n=2$, 
\[	R=\frac{1}{1/R_1+1/R_2}=\frac{R_1\;R_2}{R_1+R_2}	\]

{\bf Current Divider:} From the current divider circuit, we see the output 
as the current through $R_2$ is
\[	I_2=\frac{V}{R_2}=\frac{IR}{R_2}=I\frac{R_1R_2/(R_1+R_2)}{R_2}
	=I\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}	\]

\htmladdimg{../figures/resistorparallel.gif}

{\bf Inductors in series:} According to KVL, the sum of voltages across 
the inductors is equal to the input voltage:
\[	v=v_1+v_2+\cdots+v_n
	=L_1\frac{di}{dt}+\cdots+L_n\frac{di}{dt}
	=(L_1+L_2+\cdots+L_n)\frac{di}{dt}
	=L\frac{di}{dt}	\]
i.e.,
\[	L=L_1+L_2+\cdots+L_n	\]

{\bf Inductors in parallel:} According to KCL, the sum of currents through 
the inductors is equal to the input current:
\[	i=i_1+i_2+\cdots+i_n
	=\frac{1}{L_1}\int v\; dt+\cdots+\frac{1}{L_n}\int v\; dt 
	=(\frac{1}{L_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{L_n})\int v\; dt
	=\frac{1}{L}\int v\; dt	 \]
we get
\[	\frac{1}{L}=\frac{1}{L_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{L_n},\;\;\;
	\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;
L=\frac{1}{1/L_1+1/L_2+\cdots+1/L_n}=L_1//L_2//\cdots//L_n \]

{\bf Capacitors in parallel:} According to KCL, the sum of currents through 
the resistors is equal to the input current:
\[	i=i_1+i_2+\cdots+i_n=C_1\frac{dv}{dt}+\cdots+C_n\frac{dv}{dt}
	=(C_1+C_2+\cdots+C_n)\frac{dv}{dt}
	=C\frac{dv}{dt}		\]
i.e.,
\[	C=C_1+C_2+\cdots+C_n	\]

{\bf Capacitors in series:} According to KVL, the sum of voltages across 
the capacitors is equal to the input voltage:
\[	v=v_1+v_2+\cdots+v_n
	=\frac{1}{C_1}\int i\;dt+\cdots+\frac{1}{C_n}\int i\;dt 
	=(\frac{1}{C_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{C_n})\int i\;dt
	=\frac{1}{C}\int i\;dt 	\]
i.e.,
\[	\frac{1}{C}=\frac{1}{C_1}+\cdots+\frac{1}{C_n},
	\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;C=\frac{1}{1/C_1+1/C_2+\cdots+1/C_n}	\]


\subsection*{Energy Sources}

{\bf Ideal Energy Sources:}
\begin{itemize}
\item An ideal current source provides constant current $I_0$ independent 
	of the voltage across it (determined by the load $R_L$).
\item An ideal voltage source provides constant voltage $V_0$ independent 
	of the current through it (determined by the load $R_L$). 
\end{itemize}
Ideal sources do not exist in reality, due to such dilemmas:
\begin{itemize}
\item if the two ends of a voltage source is a short circuit ($R=0$), what 
	is the output voltage? 
\item if the two ends of a current source is an open circuit ($R=\infty$),
	what is the output current?
\end{itemize}

{\bf Voltage Source:} In reality, all voltage sources (e.g., a battery or a 
voltage amplifier) have a nonzero internal resistance $R_0>0$ in series with 
the voltage source that causes the actual output voltage $V_L$ to be lower 
than $V_0$ depending on the load current $I_L$. According to voltage divider:
\[	V_L=V_0-IR_0=V_0 \frac{R_L}{R_0+R_L}	
	\stackrel{R_0\rightarrow 0}{\Longrightarrow}V_0	\]
Only in the ideal case when $R_0=0$ will $V_L=V_0$. For $R_0>0$, the 
heavier the load ($R_L \downarrow$), the larger the load current 
($I \uparrow$), and the lower the voltage ($V_L\downarrow$). 
\[ R_L \downarrow \Longrightarrow I \uparrow \Longrightarrow R_0I \downarrow
	\Longrightarrow V_L \downarrow \]
In particular, when the load is a short circuit ($R_L=0$), the output 
voltage of a battery is zero (instead of the specified $V_0=1.5V$), as t
he voltage drop across the nonzero internal resistance $R_0$ is the same 
as $V_0$, i.e., the electric energy of the battery is consumed internally,
with no energy delivered to external circuit.

\htmladdimg{../figures/voltagesource.gif}

The slope of the voltage-current curve is the internal resistance:
\[	R_0=\frac{\triangle V}{\triangle I}	\]

{\bf Current Source:} In reality, all current sources (e.g., a photo cell 
or a current amplifier) have an internal resistance $R_0<\infty$ in parallel 
to the current source that causes the actual output current $I_L$ to be 
lower than $I_0$ depending on the load voltage $V_L$. According to current
divider:
\[	I_L=I_0-\frac{V}{R_0}=I_0 \frac{R_0}{R_0+R_L}
	\stackrel{R_0\rightarrow \infty}{\Longrightarrow}I_0	\]
Only in the ideal case when $R_0=\infty$ will $I_L=I_0$. For $R_0<\infty$,
the larger the load resistance ($R_L \uparrow$), the smaller the current 
$I_L\uparrow$.
\[ R_L \uparrow \Longrightarrow V \uparrow \Longrightarrow V/R_0 \uparrow
	\Longrightarrow I_L \downarrow \]

\htmladdimg{../figures/currentsource.gif}

The slope of the voltage-current curve is the internal resistance:
\[	R_0=\frac{\triangle V}{\triangle I}	\]

{\bf Equivalent Circuits and Source Transformation:}

Two circuits with the same voltage-current relation (V-I characteristics)
at the output port are considered equivalent, as they have the same 
external behavior, although they may be different internally.

\htmladdimg{../figures/sourcetransform.gif}

A voltage source can be equivalently converted into a current source and
vise versa:
\begin{itemize} 
\item The voltage-current relation of a voltage source ($V_0, R_0$) is:
	$V=V_0-R_0I$;
\item The voltage-current relation of a current source ($I_0, R'_0$) is:
	$V=R'_0(I_0-I)$.
\end{itemize} 
If we let $R_0=R'_0$ and $V_0=R_0I_0$ or $I_0=V_0/R_0$, then the two 
sources have the same V-I characteristics and they are equivalent, i.e.,
the voltage and current sources can be equivalently converted to each other
by
\[ \left\{ \begin{array}{r} R_0=R'_0 \\ I_0=V_0/R_0 \end{array} \right.
\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{or}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
\left\{ \begin{array}{r} R_0=R'_0 \\ V_0=I_0 R_0 \end{array} \right. \]

{\bf Example:} A voltage source of $V_0=1V$ and $R_0=1\Omega$ can be
converted to a current source of $I_0=V_0/R_0=1A$ with the same $R_0$
(and vice versa). For a load of $R_L=1\Omega$, both energy sources will
provide the load current $I_L=0.5A$ and load voltage $V_L=0.5V$.

{\bf Power Delivery}

\begin{itemize}
\item If the direction of the current $I$ going through a voltage source $V$ 
is from high potential (+) to low (-), then the source is delivering power
$W=VI$.

\item If the direction of the current is reversed, then the power 
delivered $W=-VI$ will be negative, i.e., the voltage source is actually 
receiving power. A typical example is the rechargeable battery in your car
that works in either of the two states.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Examples}

{\bf Example 1, Reduce load effect}

When cascading two pieces of circuit (e.g., connecting two voltage 
amplifiers in series with one driving the other), it is important to 
consider both the input and output impedances (resistances for now) of 
the circuit. 

\htmladdimg{../figures/cascade.gif}

\begin{itemize}
\item We want the output impedance $R_{out}$ of the first circuit to be 
	small, so that it can drive heavy load (the second circuit with 
	small input impedance) with little effect on the output voltage. 
\item On the other hand, we want the input impedance $R_{in}$ of the second
	circuit to be large, so that it will cause little change of the 
	output of the previous circuit. 
\end{itemize}
For example, to amplify the weak signal from the antenna, a cascade of 
{\bf voltage amplifiers} is needed in a radio or TV receiver. To maximize
the signal voltage passed from one amplifier to the next, their input 
impedance should be high and their output impedance should be low.

{\bf Example 2, Minimize loss in power line:} 

\htmladdimg{../figures/powerdelivery.gif}

The power loss along the 
power transmission line between the power plant and the consumer should 
be minimized. Assume the resistance of the power line is $R_T$ and the 
consumer load is $R_L$. Also assume the voltage on the consumer's side 
of the power line is $V_L$.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The power consumption is $P_L=V_L I$, i.e., $I=P_L/V_L$
	\item The transmission power loss is $P_T=R_T I^2=R_T P_L^2/V_L^2$
\end{itemize}
For fixed transmission resistance $R_T$ and power consumption $P_L$ by
the consumer, the power loss along the transmission line $P_T$ can be 
minimized only by increasing the voltage $V_L$. For example, when the 
voltage is doubled, the power loss is reduced four times.

{\bf Example 3, Maximize power delivery}

\htmladdimg{../figures/powermatch.gif}

Sometimes we want to maximize the power delivered from the voltage source 
to the load:
\[	P_L=I^2 R_L=\frac{V_0^2}{(R_0+R_L)^2} R_L	\]
where $R_0$ is the internal resistance of the voltage source. For example,
in a {\bf power amplifier}, the power delivered to the load, as a function
of the load $R_L$, needs to be maximized. To do so, we let
\[	\frac{d}{dR_L} P_L(R_L)=0
	=V_0^2\frac{(R_0+R_L)^2-2R_L(R_0+R_L)}{(R_0+R_L)^4}	
	=V_0^2\frac{R_0-R_L}{(R_0+R_L)^3}	
\]
and get $R_L=R_0$, i.e., when the load is equal to the internal resistance
of the voltage source, the power it receives is maximal 
\[	P_L=\frac{V_0^2}{(R_0+R_L)^2} R_L|_{R_L=R_0}=\frac{V_0^2}{4R_0} \]
In this case, the load current is $I=V_0/2R_0$. 

The efficiency of the circuit is defined as the ratio of the power 
delivered to the load $R_L$ and the power generated by the source $R_0$:
\[	\eta=\frac{P_L}{P_0}=\frac{I^2 R_L}{I^2 (R_0+R_L)}
	=\frac{R_L}{R_0+R_L}	\]
We see that when $R_L=R_0$, the load receives maximal power but the 
efficiency is only $50\%$. The efficiency will approach 1 when $R_L \gg R_0$,
but in this case the power received by the load is not maximal. In power 
network, it is more desirable to have high efficiency to avoid wasting 
energy than delivering maximal power. But in communication network and
other applications with small power, efficiency can be sacrificed to 
maximize the load power. For example, in a audio system, it is important 
for the speaker's impedance to match the output impedance of the power 
amplification circuit, so that the speaker can receive maximum power.
