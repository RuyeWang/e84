All electrical engineers know that ``ELI the ICE man'' was the guy who delivered ICE to 
people's houses before electricity and refrigerators were available. But few people know
the rest of the story. *

<P>
As people became more greedy for comfort, they wanted more ICE delivered to cool their 
houses in the summer. So ELI became super busy delivering ICE, as it turned out each 
house would need 5 tons of ICE per day to keep it comfortably cool. Years later, when 
electricity and air conditioners became available, the tradition was kept. Nowadays the 
air conditioners are rated in "tons", where 1 ton=12,000 Btu** per hour is the power 
needed to milt one ton of ICE per day. So if you run a 5-ton air conditioner continuously,
the cooling you get is equivalent to melting 5 tons of ICE delivered to your house every 
day, by who else but ELI the ICE man.

of water by 1 degree F (0.556 degree C).
