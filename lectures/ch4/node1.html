The <A ID="tex2html1"
  HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube#Diodes"><EM>vacuum tubes</EM></A>
were widely used for various purposes in electronics, mostly voltage 
and power amplification, before the invention of solid state semiconductor 
devices in the 1940's. Since then semiconductor devices have gradually replaced
vacuum tubes in most of such applications, due to many of their favorable 
properties such as small size, light weight, low energy consumption, high 
frequency capability, and high reliability. However, vacuum tubes can still 
find some applications even today, such as high power radio frequency transmitters
and microwave ovens. Although the physics of vacuum tubes and semiconductor 
devices is very different, the basic functions are similar, such as controlling
current through small voltage.

because the atoms have only one electron on the out-most layer or shell, called
<A ID="tex2html2"
  HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_electron"><EM>valence electron (VE)</EM></A>, which is only loosely bound 
to the atom and can easily become a free electron freely movable under an applied
voltage to conduct electricity. 

<P>
On the other hand, insulators do not conduct electricity as no free electrons 
exist in the material.

Here is a table showing the maximum number of electrons in each shell.
In general, there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.32ex; vertical-align: -0.12ex; " SRC="img4.svg"

level is not necssarily completely filled, and the outmost layer, the 
valence shell, can only have no more than 8 valence electrons.

<P>
The conductivity of those elements with four valence electrons in the carbon 
group is not as good as the conductors but still better than the insulators, 
and they are given the name semiconductors. The two semiconductors of great 
importance are silicon (Si <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.09ex; vertical-align: -0.31ex; " SRC="img6.svg"
 ALT="$2+8+4=14$"></SPAN>) and germanium (Ge <!-- MATH

 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG STYLE="height: 2.09ex; vertical-align: -0.31ex; " SRC="img7.svg"
 ALT="$2+8+18+4=32$"></SPAN>), both 
of which have four valence electrons. Their crystal structure <EM>lattice</EM>
has a tetrahedral pattern with each atom sharing one valence electron with 
each of its four neighbors to form the <EM>covalent bonds</EM>. 

<P>
If an electron gains enough thermal energy (1.1 eV for Si or 0.7 eV for
Ge), it may break the covalent bond and becomes a free electron of negative
charge, while leaving a vacancy or a <EM>hole</EM> of positive charge. In an 
electric field, a free electron may move to a new location to fill a hole 
there, i.e., both such electrons and holes contribute to electrical conduction. 
Such crystal is called <EM>intrinsic semiconductor</EM>.

<P>
At room temperature, relatively few electrons gain enough energy to become
free electrons, the over all conductivity of such materials is low, thereby
their name semiconductors, and the material is neither a good conductor nor
a good insulator.

The conductivity of semiconductor material can be improved by doping, i.e.,
by adding an impurity element with either three or five valence electrons,
called, respectively, trivalent and pentavalent elements. A semiconductor
is called either intrinsic or extrinsic, depending on whether it contains
any doped impurity.

<LI><B>N-type semiconductor:</B>

<P>
When a small amount of pentavalent donor atoms (e.g., phosphorus (P) and
Arsenic (As)) is added, a silicon atom in the lattice may be replaced by
a donor atom with four of its valence electrons forming the covalent bounds 
and one extra free electron. This is an <EM>N-type</EM> semiconductor whose 
conductivity is much improved compared to the intrinsic semiconductors, due 
to the extra free electrons in the lattice, which are called <EM>predominant
or majority current carriers</EM>. There also exist some tiny number of holes 
called <EM>minority carriers</EM>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>P-type semiconductor:</B>

<P>
When a small amount of trivalent acceptor atoms (e.g., boron (B) and aluminum
(Al)) is added, a silicon atom in the lattice may be replaced by an acceptor
atom with only three valence electrons forming three covalent bounds and a 
hole in the lattice. This is a <EM>P-type</EM> semiconductor whose conductivity 
is also much improved compared to the intrinsic semiconductors, due to the 
holes in the lattice, which are called <EM>predominant or majority current 
carriers</EM>. There also exist some tiny number of free electrons called 
<EM>minority carriers</EM>.

<LI><B>PN-Junction</B>

<P>
When P-type and N-type materials are in contact with each other, a 
PN-junction is formed due to these two effects:

<UL>
<LI><B>Diffusion:</B>

<P>
Although both sides are electrically neutral, they have different
concentration of electrons (the N-type) and holes (the P-type), and 
a <EM>diffusion current</EM> is formed by the diffusion of the higher
concentration of the freely movable electrons in the N-type material 
that move across the PN-junction from the N side to the P, due to the
thermal motion. They arrive at the P side to fill some of the holes
there. Equivalently, we can also consider the holes are diffusing
from the P side to the N side.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Electric Field</B>

<P>
If no other forces were involved, the diffusion would carry out 
continuously until the free electrons and holes are uniformly distributed
across both materials. However, as the result of the diffusion process,
electrical field is gradually established, negative on the side of P-type 
material due to the extra electrons, positive on the side of N-type 
material due to the loss of free electrons. This electrical field prevents
further diffusion as the electrons on the N-type side are expelled from
the P-type side by the electrical field.

<IMG STYLE=""

 ALT="pn_junction1.gif">

<P>
The effects of both diffusion and electric field eventually lead to an 
equilibrium where the two effects balance each other so that there are
no more charge carriers (free electrons or holes) crossing the PN-junction.
This region around the PN-junction, called the <EM>depletion region</EM> as 
there no longer exist freely movable charge carriers, becomes a barrier 
between the two ends of the material that prevent current to flow through.

<B>Solar Cell</B>

<P>
A solar cell converts light energy to electrical energy and is a current 
source. When a photon of light hits a piece of semiconductor material 
(PN-junction), it either goes straight through material if its energy is 
lower than the band-gap energy of the silicon semiconductor, or is absorbed
by the silicon if its energy is greater than the band-gap energy. In the
latter case, an electron-hole pair is produced, and the electron and hole
are separated by the internal electric filed near the PN-junction. the 
electrons are pulled by the positive potential on the N side and the 
holes are pulled by the negative potential on the P side, thereby forming
a current through the external circuit. The solar cell is a current source,
as the incoming flux of photons causes the current (not voltage).
