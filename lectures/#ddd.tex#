{\bf Solving AC circuit by phasor method}

If only the steady state solutions of the DE describing an AC circuit is of 
interest, the phasor method can be used to solve the problem algebraically 
without solving the DEs. Specifically, all sinusoidal variables are represented 
as phasors in terms of their amplitudes and phases, and all components in the 
circuit (L and C, as well as R) are represented by their impedances, so that 
all the laws (Ohm's law, KCL and KVL, current and voltage dividers, parallel 
and series combinations of components) and methods (loop current and node 
voltage methods, Thevenin's and Norton's theorems, etc.) discussed for DC 
circuit can be applied.

Operations on sinusoidal variables based on the trigonometric identities
are in general lengthy and tedious. The phasor method can convert such 
sinusoidal variables to vectors in complex plane and thereby simplify the 
operations. 

The phasor represents the amplitude (effective or RMS value) and phase of a 
sinusoidal function, but leaves out its frequency as it is known to be the
same for all sinusoidal variables in the system.

Specifically here are the three steps of the phasor method for arithmetic 
operation of two sinusoidal functions $x(t)=A\cos(\omega t+\phi)$ and 
$y(t)=B\cos(\omega t+\psi)$ of the same frequency:
\begin{itemize}
\item Represent each sinusoidal function as a phasor:
  \[ x(t)=A\;\cos(\omega t+\phi)=Re[A\,e^{j(\omega t+\phi)}]
  =Re[A/\sqrt{2} e^{j\phi} \sqrt{2}e^{j\omega t}]=Re[\dot{X} \sqrt{2} e^{j\omega t}] 
  \]
  where $\dot{X}=A/\sqrt{2}e^{j\phi}=A_{rms} e^{j\phi}$ is the phasor of $x(t)$. 
  Similarly we also get $\dot{Y}=B_{rms}e^{j\psi}$.
\item Carry out any arithmetic operation (represented by *) on the phasors:
  \[ \dot{Z}=\dot{X}\;*\;\dot{Y}=A_{rms}e^{j\phi} \;*\; B_{rms}e^{j\psi} \]
\item Convert resulting phasor back to a time function:
  \[ z(t)=x(t)\;*\;y(t)=Re[\dot{Z} \sqrt{2}e^{j\omega t}]  \]
\end{itemize}

The operations on the original sinusoidal variables require solving 
differential equations, while the operations on their phasors only require 
solving algebraic equations. This is the main advantage of the phasor method.


{\bf Generalized Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's Laws}

In general, all methods such as Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's Laws used for DC 
circuits composed of resistors can be generalized to AC circuits composed 
of capacitors, inductors, as well as resistors, all represented by their
impedances. Also, if we assume all voltages and currents in a circuit are 
sinusoids of same frequency $\omega$, they can be represented as complex 
phasors.

The Ohm's law can be generalized to become:
\[ Z=\frac{\dot{V}}{\dot{I}},\;\;\;\;\;\;\dot{I}=\frac{\dot{V}}{Z},
\;\;\;\;\;\dot{V}=Z\dot{I} \]
and the Kirchhoff's laws can now be stated as:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Current Law (KCL):} The vector sum of the currents into a node
  is zero $\sum_k \dot{I}_k=0$.
\item {\bf Voltage Law (KVL):} The vector sum of the voltages around a loop 
  is zero $\sum_k \dot{V}_k=0$.
\end{itemize}


{\bf Example:}

The RL circuit considered previously can now be resolved by the phasor method,
as only the steady state solution is of interest. Specifically, here the 
current $i(t)$ can be much more easily found by generalized Ohm's law. 
The complex representation of the input voltage is 
\[	
{\bf V}=e^{j\omega t}	
\]
The overall complex impedance of the two elements in series is:
\[
Z=Z_R+Z_L=R+j\omega L=|Z| e^{j\angle Z}=\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2L^2}\;e^{j \phi} 
\]
where $\phi=tan^{-1}(\omega L/R)$. By generalized Ohm's law, 
the complex representation of the current can be found to be:
\[
  {\bf I}=\frac{{\bf V}}{Z}
  =\frac{e^{j\omega t}}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2L^2}\;e^{j\phi}}
  =\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2L^2}} e^{j(\omega t-\phi)}	
\]
and the real current is
\[
i(t)=Re[{\bf I}]=Re\left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2 L^2}}e^{j(\omega t-\phi)}\right]
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2 L^2}}\cos(\omega t-\phi)	
\]
Note that in general, the {\bf frequency response function (FRF)} of 
the system is defined as the ratio of the output to the input of the
system, both represented as complex exponentials. In this specific case,
we have
\[
H=\frac{{\bf I}}{{\bf V}}=\frac{1}{Z} 
\]
with 
\[
|H|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2L^2}},\;\;\;\;\;\angle H=-\phi 
\]
Therefore the steady state output can be found to be:
\[
i(t)=|H| \cos(\omega t+\angle H)
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2 L^2}}\cos(\omega t-\phi)	
\]
The second method, much easier than the first one, is actually a short 
cut representation of the first DE method. This is the justification of
the complex variable or phasor method for analyzing AC circuits. However,
note that the phasor method can only find the steady state solution. The
homogeneous differential equation will have to be solved to obtain the
transient solution.

{\bf Example:} 

Solve the circuit below. The voltage from the generator is 
$v(t)=28.3\;\cos(5000t+45^\circ)\;V$.

First find the impedances and admittances of the components and the two
branches. As $\omega=5000$, we get
\begin{itemize}
\item $Y_C=j\omega C=j\;5000\times 10^{-5}=j0.05=0.05\angle{90^\circ}$,

	$Z_C=1/Y_C=1/j0.05=-j20=20\angle{-90^\circ}$
\item $Z_L=j\omega L=j5000\times 4\times 10^{-3}=0+j20=20\angle{90^\circ}$,

	$Y_L=1/Z_L=-j0.05=0.05\angle{-90^\circ}$
\item $Z_R=R=20+j0=20\angle{0^\circ}$

\item $Z_{RL}=Z_R+Z_L=20+j20=20\sqrt{2}\angle{45^\circ}$,
	$Y_{RL}=1/Z_{RL}=1/20\sqrt{2}\angle{45^\circ}
	=0.025\sqrt{2}\angle{-45^\circ}=0.025-j0.025$

\item $Y_{load}=Y_C+Y_{RL}=j0.05+0.025-j0.025=0.025+j0.025
	=0.025\sqrt{2}\angle{45^\circ}$
\end{itemize}
Next express voltage $v(t)=28.3\;\cos(5000t+45^\circ)\;V$ in phasor form
$\dot{V}=20\angle{45^\circ}$, and find currents in phasor form:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\dot{I}_{load}=Y_{load}\dot{V}=(20\angle{45^\circ})\;
	(0.025\sqrt{2}\angle{45^\circ})=0.5\sqrt{2}\angle{90^\circ}$,

	$i_{load}(t)=Re[\dot{I}\sqrt{2}e^{j5000t}]=\cos(5000t+90^\circ)$
\item $\dot{I}_C=\dot{V}Y_C=(0.05\angle{90^\circ})(20\angle{45^\circ})
	=1\angle{135^\circ}=-0.5\sqrt{2}+j0.5\sqrt{2}$,

	$i_C(t)=\sqrt{2}\cos(5000t+135^\circ)$
\item $\dot{I}_{RL}=Y_{RL}\dot{V}=(0.025\sqrt{2}\angle{-45^\circ})(20\angle{45^\circ})
	=0.5\sqrt{2}\angle{0^\circ}=0.5\sqrt{2}$,

	$i_{RL}(t)=\cos(5000t)$
\item $\dot{V}_R=Z_R\dot{I}_{RL}=(20\angle{0^\circ})(0.5\sqrt{2}\angle{0^\circ})
	=10\sqrt{2}\angle{0^\circ}=10\sqrt{2}+j0$,

	$i_R(t)=20\;\cos(5000t)$
\item $\dot{V}_L=Z_L\dot{I}_{RL}=(20\angle{90^\circ})(0.5\sqrt{2}\angle{0^\circ})
	=10\sqrt{2}\angle{90^\circ}=0+j10\sqrt{2}$,

	$v_L(t)=20\;\cos(5000t+90^\circ)$.
\end{itemize}
Verify: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\dot{V}_R+\dot{V}_L=10\sqrt{2}+j10\sqrt{2}=20\angle{45^\circ}
	=\dot{V}$
\item $\dot{I}_C+\dot{I}_{RL}=0.5\sqrt{2}-0.5\sqrt{2}+j0.5\sqrt{2}
	=0.5\sqrt{2}\angle{90^\circ}=\dot{I}_{load}$
\end{itemize}
