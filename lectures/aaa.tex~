\subsection*{Sinusoidal Functions}

Sinusoidal variables are of special importance in electrical and 
electronic systems, not only because they occur frequently in such 
systems, but also because any periodical signal can be represented 
as a linear combination of a set of sinusoidal signals of different 
frequencies, amplitudes, and phase angles (Fourier transform theory).

A sinusoidal variable (voltage or current) can be written as
\[
x(t)=A\;\cos(\omega t + \phi),\;\;\;\mbox{or}\;\;\;
x(t)=A\;\sin(\omega t+\phi+\pi/2) 
\]
The three parameters $A$, $\omega$ and $\phi$ represent three 
important elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em $A$: amplitude or peak value}
\item {\em $\phi$: phase angle $0 \le \phi \le 2\pi$ in radians or
	$0^\circ \le \phi \le 360^\circ$ in degrees.}
\item {\em $\omega=2\pi f=2\pi/T$: angular frequency in radians per 
  second}, where $f=1/T$ is the frequency measured by cycles per
  second (in Hertz, Hz), and $T$ is cycle time or period (in second).
  \[
  \omega=2\pi f=2\pi/T,\;\;\;\;f=1/T=\omega/2\pi,\;\;\;T=1/f=2\pi/\omega 
  \]
\end{itemize}

Sinusoidal functions are closely related to complex exponentials due
to Euler's formula:
\[
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
  e^{ j\theta}=\cos\theta+j\,\sin\theta\\
  e^{-j\theta}=\cos\theta-j\,\sin\theta \end{array} \right.
\;\;\;\;\;\;
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
  \cos\theta=(e^{j\theta}+e^{-j\theta})/2\\
  \sin\theta=(e^{j\theta}-e^{-j\theta})/2j 
\end{array} \right.  
\]
As exponential functions can be much more conveniently manipulated 
than sinusoidal functions, a sinusoidal function is often considered
as the real or imaginary part of the corresponding complex variable:
\[
A\;\cos(\omega t+\phi)=Re[A\;e^{j\omega t+\phi}],\;\;\;\;
A\;\sin(\omega t+\phi)=Im[A\;e^{j\omega t+\phi}]	
\]


{\bf Example:} (Homework)

A sinusoidal current with a frequency of 60 Hz reaches a positive
maximum of 20A at $t=2 \; ms$. Give the expression of this current 
as a function of time $i(t)$.

\htmladdnormallink{Answer}{../ch1_sub0/index.html}

{\bf Average Value} 

The average of a time varying current $i(t)$ is the steady or DC 
(direct current) value of current $I_{av}$ that in period $T$ would 
transfer the same charge $Q$:
\[	
I_{av}T=Q=\int_0^T i(t) dt,\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;
I_{av}=\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T i(t) dt	
\]
Similarly, the average voltage is defined as:
\[
V_{av}=\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T v(t) dt	
\]
If the current/voltage is periodic, i.e., it repeats itself every 
time cycle $T$, then $i(t)=i(t+T)$ and $v(t)=v(t+T)$. The reciprocal 
of $T$ is called the {\em fundamental frequency}. In particular, for 
a sinusoidal current 
\[
i(t)=I_p\,\sin(\omega t)=I_p\,\sin(2\pi ft)=I_P\,\sin(2\pi t/T)
\]
the average over the complete cycle $T=1/f$ is always zero (the charge
transferred during the first half is the opposite to that transferred
in the second). However, we can consider the half-cycle average over 
$T/2$:
\begin{eqnarray} 
  I_{av}&=&\frac{1}{T/2}\int_0^{T/2} i(t)\; dt
  =\frac{2}{T}\int_0^{T/2} \;I_P\,\sin(2\pi t/T)\;dt	
  =-\frac{2}{T}\frac{TI_P}{2\pi} \cos(2\pi t/T)\bigg|_0^{T/2}
  \nonumber \\
  &=& \frac{1}{\pi}\left[\cos(0)-\cos(\pi)\right]I_P
  =\frac{2}{\pi}I_P\;=0.637\,I_P
  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

{\bf Effective or RMS Value}

The effective value of a time-varying current $i(t)$ or voltage is the 
constant value of current $I_{rms}$ or voltage $V_{rms}$ that in period $T$ 
would transfer the same amount of energy:
\begin{eqnarray}
  W=\int_0^T p(t) dt&=&R\int_0^T i^2(t) dt
  =R I^2_{rms}T
  \nonumber \\
  &=&\frac{1}{R}\int_0^T v^2(t) dt=\frac{1}{R}V^2_{rms}T
  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
i.e.,
\[ 
I_{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T i^2(t) dt},\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{or}\;\;\;\;\;\;
V_{rms}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T v^2(t) dt}	
\]
As $I_{rms}$ or $V_{rms}$ is the ``square root of the mean of the squared value'',
it is also called the {\em root-mean-square (rms)} current or voltage.

For a sinusoidal variable $i(t)=I_p\,\cos(\omega t)$, we have
($\cos^2\alpha=[1+\cos(2\alpha)]/2$) 
\[ 
I^2_{rms} = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T i^2(t) dt
= \frac{I^2_p}{T}\int_0^T \cos^2(2\pi t/T) dt
= \frac{I^2_p}{2T}\int_0^T [1+\cos(4\pi t/T)]\; dt=\frac{I^2_p}{2} 
\]
i.e.,
\[
I_{rms}=\frac{I_p}{\sqrt{2}}=I_p\;0.707
\]
Similarly, for $v(t)=V_p\,\cos(\omega t)$, we also have 
\[
V_{rms}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=V_p\;0.707
\]

\subsection*{Phasor Representation of Sinusoidal Variables}

In AC circuit analysis, it is not convenient to manipulate the sinusoidal
functions (currents and voltages) involving trigonometric identities. We
can consider such sinusoidal function as the real (or imaginary) part of 
some rotating vectors in complex plane, and their arithmetic operations 
(addition, multiplication, etc.) can be more conveniently carried out 
(\htmladdnormallink{review of complex arithmetic}{http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e84/lectures/ch3/node21.html}).

Specifically, consider two sinusoidal functions 
\[
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
  x(t)=A\cos(\omega t+\phi)=Re[A e^{j\phi}e^{j\omega t}]=Re[\dot{X}e^{j\omega t}]\\
  y(t)=B\cos(\omega t+\psi)=Re[B e^{j\psi}e^{j\omega t}]=Re[\dot{Y}e^{j\omega t}]
\end{array} \right. 
\]
where $Ae^{j(\omega t+\phi)}$ and $Be^{j(\omega t+\psi)}$ can be considered as two
vectors, with different initial phase, rotating CCW in the complex plane. 
As the two sinusoidal functions have the same frequency, the two vectors 
are rotating at the same rate. When observed in the same rotating reference 
frame, they become standing still, i.e., we can simply drop the time-varying 
component $e^{j\omega t}$, and represent the functions in terms of their 
{\em phasors} for their amplitudes and phases only:
\[
\dot{X}=Ae^{j\phi},\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\dot{Y}=Be^{j\psi}
\]

Given this phasor representation, we can get the real sinusoidal function 
back:
\[
x(t)=Re[\dot{X} e^{j\omega t}]=Re[A e^{j\phi} e^{j\omega t}]=A\cos(\omega t+\phi)
\]
A phasor may be represented simply by a capital letter (e.g., $V$ or $I$)
if no confusion will be caused. Also sometimes the RMS value
$A_{rms}=A/\sqrt{2}$, instead of the peak value $A$, is used in phasor.

\htmladdimg{../figures/RotatingVectors.gif}

The sum of the two sinusoidal function can now be found as the real part of
the rotating vector sum:
\begin{eqnarray}
  x(t)+y(t)&=&A\cos(\omega t+\phi)+B\cos(\omega t+\psi)
  \nonumber\\
  &=&Re[\dot{X}e^{j\omega t}]+Re[\dot{Y}e^{j\omega t}]
  =Re[(\dot{X}+\dot{Y})e^{j\omega t}]
  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The addition can be more easily carried out in the phasor form as vectors 
in the complex plane, than in the time domain.

%\htmladdimg{../figures/PhasorAddition3.png}

\htmladdimg{../figures/phasors.png}

{\bf Example} 

Consider three sinusoidal voltage sources $v_1(t)=6\sqrt{2}\;\sin(\omega t)$,
$v_2(t)=12\sqrt{2}\;\sin(\omega t+\pi/2)$ and 
$v_3(t)=4\sqrt{2}\;\sin(\omega t-\pi/2)$ in series. According to the KVL, the 
overall voltage will be the algebraic sum of the three:
\[ 	v(t)=v_1(t)+v_2(t)+v_3(t)
	=6\sqrt{2}\;\sin(\omega t)+12\sqrt{2}\;\sin(\omega t+\pi/2)
	+4\sqrt{2}\;\sin(\omega t-\pi/2)	\]

\htmladdimg{../figures/sinusoidalsum.gif}

While the addition of these sinusoidal functions is not easy to carry out
(still remember all the trigonometric identities?), it is quite straight 
forward to find the vector sum if the voltages are represented as phasors:
\begin{eqnarray}
\dot{V}&=&\dot{V}_1+\dot{V}_2+\dot{V}_3=6\angle 0^\circ+12\angle 90^\circ+
4\angle -90^\circ	
\nonumber \\
&=&6+j12-j4=6+j8=10 \angle \left[\tan^{-1}(8/6)\right]=10\angle 53.1^\circ	
\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
The resulting voltage is $v(t)=10\sqrt{2}\;sin(\omega t+53.1^\circ)$

\htmladdimg{../figures/vectorsum.gif}

\htmladdimg{../figures/sinusoidalsum1.gif}


{\bf Phasor and the Fourier transform}

A sinusoidal function $x(t)=A\cos(\omega t+\phi)$ can be expressed in
either Fourier transform (Fourier series) or phasor representation:
\begin{eqnarray}
  x(t)&=&A\cos(\omega t+\phi)=Re[Ae^{j\phi}\;e^{j\omega t}]=Re[\dot{X} e^{j\omega t}]
  \;\;\;\;\;\mbox{(phasor)}
  \nonumber \\
  &=&\left(\frac{A}{2}e^{j\phi}\right)e^{j\omega t}
  +\left(\frac{A}{2}e^{-j\phi}\right)e^{-j\omega t}
  =X_1 e^{j\omega t}+X_{-1}e^{-j\omega t}\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{(Fourier coefficients)}
\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
We see that the phasor and the Fourier coefficients are essentially 
the same, in the sense that they are both coefficients representing the 
amplitude and phase of the complex exponential function $e^{j\omega t}$:
\[
\dot{X}=Ae^{j\phi},\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
X_1=\frac{A}{2}e^{j\phi},\;\;\;X_1=\frac{A}{2}e^{-j\phi}
\]
In both cases the real time function can be obtained (inverse Fourier
transform) by either adding the two complex vectors $X_1e^{j\omega t}$ and 
$X_{-1}e^{-j\omega t}$ rotating in opposite directions (CCW and CW), or simply
taking the real part of the complex variable $\dot{X}e^{j\omega t}$

\begin{comment}
According to the Fourier theory, any time function (satisfying certain 
mathematical conditions) $x(t)$ can be decomposed into a linear combination
of sinusoidal (complex exponential) components:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $x(t)=x(t+T)$ is periodical with period $T$, it can be Fourier
  expanded into
  \[
  x_T(t)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty X[k] e^{jk\omega_0t},\;\;\;\;\;\;(\omega_0=2\pi/T)
  \]
  where $X[k]$ is the complex coefficient of the kth frequency component
  \[
  X[k]=\frac{1}{T}\int_T x_T(t)e^{-jk\omega_0t}
  \]
  When $x_T(t)$ is real, the above becoems:
  \[
  x_T(t)=X[0]+2\sum_{k=1}^\infty |X[k]|\cos(k\omega_0 t+\angle X[k])
  \]
\item If $x(t)$ is not periodical, i.e., $T=\infty$, it can be expressed as
  \[
  x(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi} \int X(\omega) e^{j\omega t} d\omega
  \]
  where $X(\omega)$ is the {\em Fourier spectrum} of the signal representing
  how the signal energy is distributed as a function of continuous frequency:
  \[
  X(\omega)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty x(t) e^{-j\omega t}\;dt
  \]
\end{itemize}
\end{comment}


{\bf Generalized Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's Laws}

In general, all methods such as Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's Laws used for DC 
circuits composed of resistors can be generalized to AC circuits composed 
of capacitors, inductors, as well as resistors, all represented by their
impedances. Also, if we assume all voltages and currents in a circuit are 
sinusoids of same frequency $\omega$, they can be represented as complex 
phasors.

The Ohm's law can be generalized to become:
\[ Z=\frac{\dot{V}}{\dot{I}},\;\;\;\;\;\;\dot{I}=\frac{\dot{V}}{Z},
\;\;\;\;\;\dot{V}=Z\dot{I} \]
and the Kirchhoff's laws can now be stated as:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Current Law (KCL):} The vector sum of the currents into a node
  is zero $\sum_k \dot{I}_k=0$.
\item {\bf Voltage Law (KVL):} The vector sum of the voltages around a loop 
  is zero $\sum_k \dot{V}_k=0$.
\end{itemize}


{\bf Solving AC circuit by phasor method}

If only the steady state solutions of the DE describing an AC circuit is of 
interest, the phasor method can be used to solve the problem algebraically 
without solving the DEs. Specifically, all sinusoidal variables are represented 
as phasors in terms of their amplitudes and phases, and all components in the 
circuit (L and C, as well as R) are represented by their impedances, so that 
all the laws (Ohm's law, KCL and KVL, current and voltage dividers, parallel 
and series combinations of components) and methods (loop current and node 
voltage methods, Thevenin's and Norton's theorems, etc.) discussed for DC 
circuit can be applied.

\htmladdimg{../figures/phasordiagram.gif}

Operations on sinusoidal variables based on the trigonometric identities
are in general lengthy and tedious. The phasor method can convert such 
sinusoidal variables to vectors in complex plane and thereby simplify the 
operations. 

The phasor represents the amplitude (effective or RMS value) and phase of a 
sinusoidal function, but leaves out its frequency as it is known to be the
same for all sinusoidal variables in the system.

Specifically here are the three steps of the phasor method for arithmetic 
operation of two sinusoidal functions $x(t)=A\cos(\omega t+\phi)$ and 
$y(t)=B\cos(\omega t+\psi)$ of the same frequency:
\begin{itemize}
\item Represent each sinusoidal function as a phasor:
  \[ x(t)=A\;\cos(\omega t+\phi)=Re[A\,e^{j(\omega t+\phi)}]
  =Re[A/\sqrt{2} e^{j\phi} \sqrt{2}e^{j\omega t}]=Re[\dot{X} \sqrt{2} e^{j\omega t}] 
  \]
  where $\dot{X}=A/\sqrt{2}e^{j\phi}=A_{rms} e^{j\phi}$ is the phasor of $x(t)$. 
  Similarly we also get $\dot{Y}=B_{rms}e^{j\psi}$.
\item Carry out any arithmetic operation (represented by *) on the phasors:
  \[ \dot{Z}=\dot{X}\;*\;\dot{Y}=A_{rms}e^{j\phi} \;*\; B_{rms}e^{j\psi} \]
\item Convert resulting phasor back to a time function:
  \[ z(t)=x(t)\;*\;y(t)=Re[\dot{Z} \sqrt{2}e^{j\omega t}]  \]
\end{itemize}

\htmladdimg{../figures/PhasorBlockDiagram1.png}

The operations on the original sinusoidal variables require solving 
differential equations, while the operations on their phasors only require 
solving algebraic equations. This is the main advantage of the phasor method.



\subsection{Impedance and Generalized Ohm's Law}

{\bf Generalized Ohm's Law}

The Ohm's law $R=V/I$ in DC circuit composed of resistors only can be 
generalized to describe the relationship between the sinusoidal voltage
and current associated with a component, a capacitor $C$, an inductor $L$, 
or a resistor $R$. The {\em impedance} of the component is defined as the 
ratio of the AC voltage and current associated with the component both 
represented as complex variables or phasors:
\[
Z=\frac{{\bf V}(t)}{{\bf I}(t)}=\frac{V_p e^{j(\omega t+\phi)}}{I_p e^{j(\omega t+\psi)}}
=\frac{V_{rms}e^{j\phi}}{I_{rms}e^{j\psi}}=\frac{\dot{V}}{\dot{I}}
=\frac{V_{rms}}{I_{rms}}e^{j(\phi-\psi)} 
\]
The impedance $Z$ is in general complex and its magnitude is the ratio of 
the magnitudes of the voltage and the current, and its phase is the phase 
difference between the voltage and the current:
\[
|Z|=\frac{|{\bf V}(t)|}{|{\bf I}(t)|}=\frac{V_p}{I_p}=\frac{V_{rms}}{I_{rms}}
,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\angle Z=\angle {\bf V}-\angle {\bf I}=\phi-\psi 
\]

\htmladdimg{../figures/ImpedanceFT.png}

As phasor representation of a sinusoidal voltage or a current of frequency
$\omega=2\pi f$ is actually the only Fourier coinfficient in the frequency
domain, the impedance can be considered as the {\em frequency response function}
of the circuit component when the current through it and the voltage across it,
both represented as phasors, are considered as the input and output of the
component, respectively. As there is only one frequency in the signal, it 
does not need to be represented.
\[
Z(j\omega)=\frac{V(j\omega)}{I(j\omega)}=\frac{Ve^{j\phi}}{Ie^{j\psi}}
=\frac{\dot{V}}{\dot{I}}=Z
\]



{\bf Impedance of Basic Components}

The impedance of a specific component can be obtained according to the
physics of the component. 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Resistor:} 
  \[ 
    {\bf V}(t)=Z_R {\bf I}(t),\;\;\;\;Z_R=\frac{{\bf V}(t)}{{\bf I}(t)} 
  \]
  As a resistor introduces no phase shift between the voltage and current, its
  impedance, same as resistance, is real:
  \[ 
  |Z_R|=\frac{|{\bf V(t)}|}{|{\bf I(t)}|}=\frac{V_p}{I_p}=R,\;\;\;\;
  \angle Z_R=0 
  \]
\item {\bf Capacitor:} 
  \[ 
    {\bf I}(t)=C \frac{d}{dt}{\bf V}(t)=C\frac{d}{dt}[V_p e^{j(\omega t+\phi)}]
    =j\omega C V_p e^{j(\omega t+\phi)}=j\omega C {\bf V}(t) 
  \]
  \[
  Z_C=\frac{{\bf V}(t)}{{\bf I}(t)}=\frac{1}{j\omega C}=\frac{-j}{\omega C},
  \;\;\;\;|Z_C|=\frac{1}{\omega C},\;\;\;\angle Z_C=-\frac{\pi}{2} 
  \]
  The phase shift introduced by a capacitor is $\angle Z_C=-\pi/2=-90^\circ$,
  i.e., the voltage lags behind the current by $90^\circ$.
\item {\bf Inductor:}
  \[
    {\bf V}(t)=L \frac{d}{dt}{\bf I}(t)=L\frac{d}{dt}[I_p e^{j(\omega t+\psi)}]
    =j\omega L I_p e^{j(\omega t+\psi)}=j\omega L {\bf I}(t) 
  \]
  \[ 
  Z_L=\frac{{\bf V}(t)}{{\bf I}(t)}=j\omega L,
  \;\;\;\;|Z_L|=\omega L,\;\;\;\angle Z_L=\frac{\pi}{2}	
  \]
  The phase shift introduced by a inductor is $\angle Z_L=\pi/2=90^\circ$,
  i.e., the voltage leads the current by $90^\circ$. 
\end{itemize}
One way to remember the phase between the voltage $E$ and current $I$ 
associated with capacitor $C$ and inductor $L$ is ``ELI the ICE man''. 
Also, consider two extreme cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item When $\omega=0$, $Z_C\rightarrow \infty$ and the capacitor has zero 
conductivity due to the insulation between its two plates (open circuit),
and $Z_L=0$ as there is no flux change in the inductor and the resistance 
of the coil is ideally zero.
\item When $\omega\rightarrow \infty$, $Z_C\rightarrow 0$ and the capacitor 
becomes highly conductive, and $Z_L\rightarrow \infty$ as the self-induced
voltage in the coil always acts against any change in the input (Lenz's Law).
\end{itemize}

{\bf Impedance and Admittance}

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Impedance}

    As a complex variable, the impedance $Z$ can be written as:
    \[	
    Z=R+jX=|Z|e^{j\angle Z}=|Z|\angle Z	
    \]
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The real part of impedance $Re[Z]=R$ is called {\bf resistance}. 
    \item The imaginary part of impedance  $Im[Z]=X$ is called {\bf reactance}. 
    \end{itemize}
    Impedance, resistance, and reactance are all measured by the same unit 
    Ohm ($\Omega$). 

    The magnitude and phase angle of $Z$ are:
    \[
    |Z|=\sqrt{R^2+X^2},\;\;\;\;\angle Z=tan^{-1}\left(\frac{X}{R}\right)	
    \]
    The impedances $Z_C=1/j\omega C=-j/\omega C$ associated with $C$ and 
    $Z_L=j\omega L$ are both purely imaginary, i.e., they are both reactance,
    indicating these components are reactive and consume no energy.

\item {\bf Admittance}

  The reciprocal of the impedance $Z$ is called {\bf admittance}:
  \[
  Y=\frac{1}{Z}=\frac{1}{R+jX}=\frac{R-jX}{R^2+X^2}=G+jB	
  \]
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The real part of admittance is called {\bf conductance}:
    \[	G=Re[Y]=\frac{R}{R^2+X^2}	\]
  \item The imaginary part of admittance is called {\bf susceptance}:
    \[	B=Im[Y]=\frac{-X}{R^2+X^2}	\]
  \end{itemize}
  Admittance, conductance and susceptance are all measured by the same 
  unit Siemens ($S$). 

  The magnitude and phase of complex admittance are
  \[
  |Y|=\sqrt{G^2+B^2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+X^2}},\;\;\;\;\;
  \angle Y=\tan^{-1} \left(\frac{B}{G}\right)=\tan^{-1} \left(\frac{-X}{R}\right)
  =-\angle Z	
  \]
\end{itemize}

\[ \mbox{Admittance}=\frac{1}{\mbox{Impedance}} \]
\[ \mbox{Impedance} = \mbox{Resistance} + j \;\mbox{Reactance} \]
\[ \mbox{Admittance} = \mbox{Conductance} + j\; \mbox{Susceptance}  \]

Impedance $Z$ and admittance $Y=1/Z$ are both complex variables. The 
real parts $Re[Z]=R$ and $Re[Y]=G$ are always positive, but the imaginary 
parts $Im[Z]=X$ and $Im[Y]=B$ can be either positive or negative. Therefore
$Z$ and $Y$ can only be in the 1st or the 4th quadrants of the complex plane.

In particular, the admittances of the three types of elements R, L
and C are
\[ Y_R=\frac{1}{R},\;\;\;\;
Y_L=\frac{1}{Z_L}=\frac{1}{j\omega L}=\frac{-j}{\omega L},\;\;\;\;
Y_C=\frac{1}{Z_C}=\frac{1}{1/j\omega C}=j\omega C	\]

Ohm's law can also be expressed in terms of admittance as well as impedance:
\[
  {\bf I}(t)=\frac{{\bf V}(t)}{Z}={\bf V}(t)Y	
\]
Sometimes it is more convenient in circuit analysis to use admittance
instead of impedance.
\begin{itemize}
\item Components parallel:
\[ Z_{total}=\frac{Z_1\;Z_2}{Z_1+Z_2},\;\;\;\;Y_{total}=Y_1+Y_2 \]
\item Components in series:
\[ Z_{total}=Z_1+Z_2,\;\;\;\;Y_{total}=\frac{Y_1\;Y_2}{Y_1+Y_2}\]
\end{itemize}


{\bf Example 1:} 

Solve the circuit below. The voltage from the generator is 
$v(t)=28.3\;\cos(5000t+45^\circ)\;V$.

\htmladdimg{../figures/phasorexample.gif}

First find the impedances and admittances of the components and the two
branches. As $\omega=5000$, we get
\begin{itemize}
\item $Y_C=j\omega C=j\;5000\times 10^{-5}=j0.05=0.05\angle{90^\circ}$,

	$Z_C=1/Y_C=1/j0.05=-j20=20\angle{-90^\circ}$
\item $Z_L=j\omega L=j5000\times 4\times 10^{-3}=0+j20=20\angle{90^\circ}$,

	$Y_L=1/Z_L=-j0.05=0.05\angle{-90^\circ}$
\item $Z_R=R=20+j0=20\angle{0^\circ}$

\item $Z_{RL}=Z_R+Z_L=20+j20=20\sqrt{2}\angle{45^\circ}$,
	$Y_{RL}=1/Z_{RL}=1/20\sqrt{2}\angle{45^\circ}
	=0.025\sqrt{2}\angle{-45^\circ}=0.025-j0.025$

\item $Y_{load}=Y_C+Y_{RL}=0.025+j0.025=0.025\sqrt{2}\angle{45^\circ}$
\end{itemize}
Next express voltage $v(t)=28.3\;\cos(5000t+45^\circ)\;V$ in phasor form
$\dot{V}=20\angle{45^\circ}$, and find currents in phasor form:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\dot{I}_{load}=Y_{load}\dot{V}=(20\angle{45^\circ})\;
	(0.025\sqrt{2}\angle{45^\circ})=0.5\sqrt{2}\angle{90^\circ}$,

\item $\dot{I}_{RL}=Y_{RL}\dot{V}=(0.025\sqrt{2}\angle{-45^\circ})(20\angle{45^\circ})

	$v_L(t)=20\;\cos(5000t+90^\circ)$.
\end{itemize}
Verify: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\dot{V}_R+\dot{V}_L=10\sqrt{2}+j10\sqrt{2}=20\angle{45^\circ}
	=\dot{V}$
\item $\dot{I}_C+\dot{I}_{RL}=0.5\sqrt{2}-0.5\sqrt{2}+j0.5\sqrt{2}

\end{itemize}

{\bf Example 2:} A current $i(t)=17\;\cos(1000t+90^\circ)=12\sqrt{2}\cos(1000t+90^\circ)$ 
flows through a circuit composed of a resistor $R=18\Omega$, and capacitor
$C=83.3\mu F=83.3\times 10^{-6}F$ and an inductor $L=30 mH=30\times 
10^{-3}H$ connected in series. Find the resulting voltage across all 
three elements.

\begin{itemize}
\item Express $i(t)$ in phasor: $\dot{I}=12\angle{90^\circ}$
\item Find impedance for each element ($\omega=1000$):
  \[
  Z_R=R=18,\;\;\;\;Z_C=1/j\omega C=12\angle{-90^\circ}=0-j12,\;\;\;\;
  Z_L=j\omega L=30\angle{90^\circ}=0+j30	
  \]
\item Find overall impedance:
  \[ 
  Z_{total}=Z_R+Z_C+Z_L=18+j(-12+30)=18+j18=18\sqrt{2}\angle{45^\circ} 
  \]
\item Find voltage across all three elements:
  \[
  \dot{V}_{total}=\dot{I}Z_{total}=(12\angle{90^\circ})\;(18\sqrt{2}\angle{45^\circ})=216\sqrt{2}\angle{135^\circ}	
  \]
  \[
  v(t)=(216\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}\cos(1000t+135^\circ)=432\;\cos(1000t+135^\circ) 
  \]
\end{itemize}
Alternatively, we can find voltage across each element:
\[
\dot{V}_R=\dot{I}Z_R=216\angle{90^\circ},\;\;\;\;
\dot{V}_C=\dot{I}Z_C=144\angle{0^\circ},\;\;\;\;
\dot{V}_L=\dot{I}Z_L=360\angle{180^\circ}	
\]
In time domain, we have
\[
v_R(t)=216\sqrt{2}\cos(1000t+\pi/2),\;\;\;
v_C(t)=144\sqrt{2}\cos(1000t),\;\;\;v_L(t)=360\sqrt{2}\cos(1000t+\pi) 
\]
Adding $\dot{V}_R$, $\dot{V}_C$, and $\dot{V}_L$, we get the total voltage
which is the same as what we got above:
\[ 
\dot{V}_{total}=\dot{V}_R+\dot{V}_C+\dot{V}_L=216\angle{90^\circ}+216\angle{180^\circ}
=216\sqrt{2}\angle{135^\circ}	
\]

{\bf Example 3:} 
In the circuit below, $v_S(t)=A\cos(10^6 t)$ with some unknown
  peak value $A$, $R_1=R_2=R_3=10\Omega$, and $L=10\,\mu H$. The 
  the RMS value of $v_2$ acorss $R_2$ is 10 V. It is also known 
  that $v_s(t)$ and $i_s(t)$ are in phase. 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Find $C$.
  \item Find the RMS values of $v_C(t)$ and $v_L(t)$.
  \item Find the RMS values of $v_{ab}$ and $v_{RC}=V_{RL}$.
  \item Find the peak value $A$ of $v_s(t)$.
  \end{itemize}

  {\bf Solution} 

  \htmladdimg{../../lectures/figures/Problems8.png}

  As $v_s(t)$ and $i_s(t)$ are in phase (zero angular difference), 
  the admittance of the parallel combinatiion of the RL and RC 
  branches must not introduce any phase shift, i.e., it is real 
  with imaginary part equal to zero:
  \begin{eqnarray}
    Y(\omega)&=&Y_{RL}(\omega)+Y_{RC}(\omega)
    =\frac{1}{R_3+j\omega L}+\frac{1}{R_2+1/j\omega C}
    \nonumber\\
    &=&\frac{1}{10+j10^6 \times 10^{-5}}+\frac{1}{10-j/10^6C}
    \nonumber
  \end{eqnarray}
  As $Im(Y)=0$, we get $Z_C(\omega)=1/\omega C=10$, i.e., 
  $C=1/10\omega=(10\times 10^6)^{-1}=0.1 \mu F$,
  $Z_{RL}=10+j\,10$, $Z_{RC}=10-j\,10$. The impedance of the 
  parallel combination of the RL and RC branches is
  \[
  Z(\omega)=\frac{1}{Y(\omega)}=Z_{RL}(\omega)||Z_{RC}(\omega)
  =\frac{(10+j10)(10-j10)}{10+j10+10-j10}
  =10
  \]
  As $|R_2|=|Z_C|=10 \Omega$, $|\dot{V}_C|=|\dot{V}_R|=10V$. But as 
  they are $\pi/2$ apart in phase, we have
  $|\dot{V}_{RC}|=|\dot{V}_{RL}|=10\sqrt{2}$.
  However, their phase difference is $\pi/2$, and $|\dot{V}_{ab}|=10\sqrt{2}$. 

  The currents through RC and RL branches are:
  \[
  |\dot{I}_{RC}|=\frac{|\dot{V}_{RC}|}{|Z_{RC}|}=\frac{10\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{10^2+10^2}}
  =1,
  \;\;\;\;\;\;
  |\dot{I}_{RL}|=\frac{|\dot{V}_{RL}|}{|Z_{RL}|}=\frac{10\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{10^2+10^2}}
  =1
  \]
  But their phase difference is $\pi/2$, we have
  \[
  |\dot{I}_s|=|\dot{I}_{RL}+\dot{I}_{RC}|=\sqrt{2}
  \]
  The voltage across $R_1$ is $V_1=RI_s=10\sqrt{2}$, and
  \[
  \dot{V}_s=\dot{V}_1+\dot{V}_{cd}=10\sqrt{2}+10\sqrt{2}=20\sqrt{2}
  \]
  The peak value is therefore $A=\sqrt{2} V_s=40\,V$
  
  
\subsection*{First Order Systems}

If we need to find out the transient response of an AC circuit to a certain 
input applied at time moment $t=0$, such as a unit step input 
\[
u(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}0&t<0\\1&t\ge 0\end{array}\right.
\]
or a constant voltage source which is connected to the circuit through a
switch which is closed at time moment $t=0$, then the phasor method discussed
above is no longer sufficient. Now the DE describing the circuit will have 
to be solved to obtain the complete solution including both the homogeneous 
(transient) solution as well as the particular (steady state) solution. 

As a simple example, the RC circuit shown below is composed of a resistor
$R$ and capacitor $C$ in series with an external voltage input $v(t)$, which 
is turned on at $t=0$, either by a switch or a step voltage $v(t)$. We also
assume the initial condition that the voltage across $C$ is $v_C(0)=V_0$ at
$t=0$. Any of the variables $v_R(t)$, $v_C(t)$, and $i(t)$ can be considered 
as the circuit's response to this input.

\htmladdimg{../figures/RL_RCcircuit.png}

\begin{itemize}
\item The RC circuit can be described by the KVL:
  \[ 
  v_R(t)+v_C(t)=R\;i(t)+v_C(t)=RC\frac{d}{dt} v_c(t)+v_c(t)
  =\tau \frac{d}{dt} v_C(t)+v_C(t)=v(t) 
  \]
  where $\tau=RC$ is the time constant of the system with the dimension of time:
  \[
    [RC]=\frac{[V]}{[I]}\frac{[Q]}{[V]}=\frac{[Q]}{[I]}=[T]	
  \]
\item Similarly, for the RL circuit we have ($v(t)=L\,di(t)/dt$)
  \[
  v_R(t)+v_L(t)=R\; i(t)+L\frac{d}{dt} i(t)=v(t)\;\;\;\;\mbox{or}\;\;\;\;\;
  \tau \frac{d}{dt} i(t)+i(t)=\frac{v(t)}{R}	
  \]
  where $\tau=L/R$ is the time constant with the dimension of time:
  \[
    \frac{[L]}{[R]}=\frac{[V][T]}{[I]}\frac{1}{[R]}=\frac{[R][T]}{[R]}=[T]	
  \]
\end{itemize}
In both cases, the polarity of $v_R$ is positive on top, and the polarities of
$v_C$ and $v_R$ are positive on the left.

In general, a first-order linear system with input $x(t)$ and output
$y(t)$ can be described by a first-order linearconstant coefficient 
differential equation (LCCDE) in the canonic form:
\[
\tau\frac{d}{dt}y(t)+y(t)=x(t)
\]
in terms of a single parameter, the {\em time constant} $\tau$.

While DC circuit analysis is carried out by solving {\em algebraic} 
equations, the analysis of AC circuits composed of capacitors, inductors 
as well as resistors will require solving differential equations. The 
solution of a DE represents the response (or output) of the circuit to 
both the {\em external input} and the {\em initial state}, and is composed 
of two parts:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Homogeneous solution} representing the {\em natural response} or
  {\em transient response} caused by the initial condition,
\item {\em Particular solutions} representing the {\em forced response} or
  {\em steady state response} caused by the external input.
\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection*{Particular Solution}

{\bf RC circuit:}

Consider an RC circuit consisted of a resistor and a capacitor in series 
connected to an AC voltage source $v(t)=\cos(\omega t)$, find the voltage
$v_C(t)$ across $C$. The governing DE describing the circuit can be obtained 
based on KVL:
\[
v_R(t)+v_C(t)=R\,i(t)+v_C(t)=RC\frac{v_C(t)}{dt}+v_C(t)
=\tau \dot{v}_C(t)+v_C(t)=v(t)=\cos(\omega t)
\]
We want to find its particular or steady state solution, while the 
homogeneous or transient solution due to the non-zero initial condition 
will be discussed later. We first consider an complex exponential input:
\[	
\tau\dot{v}_C(t)+v_C(t)=e^{j\omega t}
\]
We assume
\[ 
v_C(t)=A\;e^{j\omega t},\;\;\;\;\;\frac{d}{dt}v_C(t)=j\omega A\;e^{j\omega t} 
\]
and substitute them back into the DE to get
\[
j\omega \tau A e^{j\omega t}+A e^{j\omega t}
=(j\omega \tau+1)A\; e^{j\omega t}=e^{j\omega t} 
\]
i.e.
\[
A=\frac{1}{j\omega\tau+1}=|A|e^{-j\phi},\;\;\;\;\mbox{where}
\;\;\;\;\;\;|A|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega^2 \tau^2+1}},\;\;\;\;\;
\phi=\angle A=tan^{-1}\omega\tau
\]
and the solution is:
\[
A\;e^{j\omega t}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega^2 \tau^2+1}} e^{j(\omega t-\phi)} 
\]
The solution for the DE with input $v(t)=\cos \omega t$ is
\[
v_C(t)=Re\left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega^2 \tau^2+1}} e^{j(\omega t-\phi)}\right]
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega^2 \tau^2+1}} \cos(\omega t-\phi)
\]

Alternatively, this RC circuit can also be resolved by the phasor
method, if only the steady state solution is of interest. 
The phasor of the input voltage $v(t)=\cos(\omega t)$ is simply 1,
and the phasor of the voltage across $C$ can be found by voltage
divider:
\[
V_C=V\frac{Z_C}{Z_R+Z_C}=\frac{1/j\omega}{R+1/j\omega}
=\frac{1}{j\omega RC+1}=\frac{1}{j\omega \tau+1}
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega^2\tau^2+1}} e^{-j\phi}
\]
where $\phi=\tan^{-1}\omega\tau$. Converting this into time domain
we get
\[
v_C(t)=Re[V_Ce^{j\omega t}]
=Re\left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega^2\tau^2+1}}e^{j(\omega t-\phi)}\right]
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\omega^2\tau^2+1}}\cos(\omega t-\phi)
\]

{\bf RL circuit:}

Given an RL circuit consisted of a resistor and an inductor in 
series connected to an AC voltage source $v(t)=\cos(\omega t)$, we
want to find the current $i(t)$. The governing DE describing the 
circuit can be obtained based on KVL:
\[
v_L(t)+v_R(t)=L\frac{d}{dt}i(t)+R\;i(t)=v(t)=\cos(\omega t)
\]
We first consider an complex exponential input:
\[	
L\frac{d}{dt}i(t)+Ri(t)=e^{j\omega t}
\]
We assume
\[ 
i(t)=A\;e^{j\omega t},\;\;\;\;\;\frac{d}{dt}i(t)=j\omega A\;e^{j\omega t} 
\]
and substitute them back into the DE to get
\[
j\omega L A e^{j\omega t}+RA e^{j\omega t}
=(R+j\omega L)A\; e^{j\omega t}=e^{j\omega t} 
\]
i.e.
\[
A=\frac{1}{R+j\omega L}=|A|e^{-j\phi},\;\;\;\;\mbox{where}
\;\;\;\;\;\;|A|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2 L^2}},\;\;\;\;\;
\phi=\angle A=tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\omega L}{R}\right)	
\]
and the solution is:
\[
A\;e^{j\omega t}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2 L^2}} e^{j(\omega t-\phi)} 
\]
The solution for the DE with input $v(t)=\cos \omega t$ is
\[
i(t)=Re\left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2 L^2}} e^{j(\omega t-\phi)}\right]
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2 L^2}} \cos(\omega t-\phi)
\]

Alternatively, this RL circuit can also be resolved by the phasor
method. Now the current $i(t)$ can be much more easily found by 
generalized Ohm's law. The phasor representation of the input voltage 
$v(t)=\cos(\omega t)$ is simply 1, and the overall complex impedance 
of the two elements in series is:
\[
Z=Z_R+Z_L=R+j\omega L=|Z| e^{j\angle Z}=\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2L^2}\;e^{j \phi} 
\]
where $\phi=tan^{-1}(\omega L/R)$. By generalized Ohm's law, 
the phasor representation of the current can be found as
\[
I=\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2L^2}\;e^{j\phi}}
  =\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2L^2}} e^{-j\phi}	
\]
and the real current is
\[
i(t)=Re\left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2 L^2}}e^{-j\phi)}e^{j\omega t}\right]
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2 L^2}}\cos(\omega t-\phi)	
\]
Note that in general, the {\em frequency response function (FRF)} of 
the system is defined as the ratio of the output to the input of the
system, both represented as complex exponentials. In this specific case,
we have
\[
H=\frac{{\bf I}}{{\bf V}}=\frac{1}{Z} 
\]
with 
\[
|H|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2L^2}},\;\;\;\;\;\angle H=-\phi 
\]
Therefore the steady state output can be found to be:
\[
i(t)=|H| \cos(\omega t+\angle H)
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{R^2+\omega^2 L^2}}\cos(\omega t-\phi)	
\]
The second method, much easier than the first one, is actually a short 
cut representation of the first DE method. This is the justification of
the complex variable or phasor method for analyzing AC circuits. However,
note that the phasor method can only find the steady state solution. The
homogeneous differential equation will have to be solved to obtain the
transient solution.

\htmladdimg{../figures/phasorfigure.gif}


\subsubsection*{Homogeneous Solution}


When the external input is zero $v_C(t)=0$, the DE is homogeneous (zero 
on the right-hand side):
\[ 
RC\frac{d}{dt} v_c(t)+v_c(t)=\tau \frac{d}{dt} v_C(t)+v_C(t)=0 
\]
The non-trivial solution of this homogeneous equation is due to some
non-zeor initial value, such as the voltage $V_0$ across the capacitor 
before $t=0$. The homogeneous solution needs to be a function whose 
derivative takes the same form as the function itself, i.e., it needs 
to be an exponential function:
\[
v_C(t)=A e^{st},\;\;\;\;\mbox{and}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\frac{d}{dt}v_C(t)=s A e^{st}
\]
Substituting them into the DE, we get
\[
\tau sA e^{st} + Ae^{st}=(\tau s+1) Ae^{st}=0 
\]
As we are not interested in the trivial solution $Ae^{st}=0$, we must 
have
\[ 
\tau s+1=0,\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;\;\;s=-\frac{1}{\tau} 
\]
Now we get $v_C(t)=Ae^{-t/\tau}$ for $t\ge 0$. The constant coefficient 
$A$ can be obtained by the initial condition $v_C(0)=V_0$:
\[ 
v_C(0)=A e^{-t/\tau}\bigg|_{t=0}=A e^{0}=V_0,
\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;\;A=V_0	
\]
Now the homogeneous solution is completely determined to be
\[
v_C(t)=V_0 e^{-t/\tau}		
\]
which decays to zero as $t\rightarrow\infty$:
\[
\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty} V_0 e^{-t/\tau}=0
\]
The current through $R$ and $C$ is
\[
i(t)=C\frac{d}{dt}\;v_C(t)=C\frac{d}{dt}\left(V_0 e^{-t/\tau}\right)
=-V_0 \frac{C}{\tau} e^{-t/\tau}=-\frac{V_0}{R} e^{-t/\tau}	
\]
The voltage across $R$ is 
\[
v_R(t)=i(t)R=-V_0 e^{-t/\tau}=-v_C(t)	
\]
This result can be verified: $v_C(t)+v_R(t)=0$.

The time constant $\tau$ can be identified on the time plot of the general
first order response $v(t)=V_0 e^{-t/\tau}=e^{-t\tau}$ with $V_0=1$. Specifically
consider the derivative of $v(t)$ evaluated at $t=0$:
\[
\frac{d}{dt}v(t)\big|_{t=0}=-\frac{1}{\tau}e^{-t/\tau}\bigg|_{t=0}=-\frac{1}{\tau}
\]
This is the slope of the tengent line of $v(t)$ at $t=0$, and $\tau$ is its
intersection with the horizontal axis.

\htmladdimg{../figures/FirstOrderTau1.png}

\subsubsection*{Complete Response I -- Constant Input}

The complete response of a non-homogeneous linear system due to both
the external input and the initial condition can be found as the sum of 
the homogeneous and particular solutions of the non-homogeneous DE with 
a non-zero right-hand side for the external input:
\[
\mbox{Complete Solution}=\mbox{Homogeneous Solution}+\mbox{Particular Solution}
\]
Specifically in the RC circuit, we have
\[
v_R(t)+v_C(t)=\tau\frac{d}{dt} v_c(t)+v_c(t)=v(t)
\]
We want to solve the DE for $v_C(t)$ as the circuit's complete response to the
input $v(t)\ne 0$ as well as the initial condition $v_C(0)=V_0\ne 0$, after a 
switch is closed at time moment $t=0$. 


\htmladdimg{../figures/RCcircuit.png}

Given an RC circuit shown above where the switch is closed at $t=0$,
we want to find the voltage $v_C(t)$ across $C$ and voltate $v_R(t)$ 
across $R$ aa a function of time for $t>0$. 

First we consider a constant (DC) input $v(t)=V_s$ applied to the circuit 
at $t=0$, i.e., a step input 
\[
v(t)=V_s u(t) =\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}V_s & t\ge 0\\0 & t<0\end{array}\right. 
\]
The solution of this inhomogeneous DE is composed of two parts, 
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Particular solution (forced response) }
  $v'_C(t)=v_C(t)|_{t\rightarrow \infty}=V_s$ due to the DC input $V_s$;
\item {\em Homogeneous solution (natural response) }: 
  $v''_C(t)=A e^{-t/\tau}$ due to the initial condition
  $v_C(t)\big|_{t=0}=v_C(0)=V_0$.
\end{itemize}
The complete solution is
\[
v_C(t)=v'_C(t)+v''_C(t)=V_s+A e^{-t/\tau}	
\]
The constant $A$ can be determined from the initial condition $v_C(0)=V_0$:
\[
v_C(0)=V_0=v_C(t)\big|_{t=0}=V_s+Ae^{0}=V_s+A,
\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.,}\;\;\;\;A=V_0-V_s	
\]
and the complete solution is
\[
v_C(t)=V_s+A e^{-t/\tau}=V_s+(V_0-V_s) e^{-t/\tau}	
\]
In particular, if $v_C(0)=V_0=0$, the solution is
\[
v_C(t)=V_s+(-V_s) e^{-t/\tau}=V_s(1-e^{-t/\tau})		
\]

The current through $C$ is
\[
i(t)=C\frac{d}{dt}\,v_C(t)=-\frac{C}{\tau}(V_0-V_s)e^{-t/\tau}
=\frac{V_s-V_0}{R}e^{-t/\tau} 
\]
The voltage across $R$ is
\[ 
v_R(t)=R\; i(t)=(V_s-V_0) e^{-t/\tau} 
\]
We can further verify that
\[
v_C(t)+v_R(t)=V_s+(V_0-V_s) e^{-t/\tau}+(V_s-V_0) e^{-t/\tau} =V_s	
\]

The plots below show $v_C(t)$ (red) and $v_R(t)$ (green) under different
initial conditions (purple) and inputs (blue).

\begin{itemize}
\item $V_0=2$, $V_s=1$, i.e., $V_0>V_s$

  %\htmladdimg{../figures/first_order_response1.gif}
  \htmladdimg{../figures/FirstOrderResponse1.png}
\item $V_0=1$, $V_s=2$, i.e., $V_0<V_s$

  %\htmladdimg{../figures/first_order_response2.gif}
  \htmladdimg{../figures/FirstOrderResponse2.png}
\end{itemize}

Note that after the switch is closed at $t=0$, 

\begin{itemize}
\item In the first case, $v_R(t)$ takes a negative value if $v_C(0)=V_0>V_s$ for 
  $t>0$, although the voltage source $V_s>0$ is positive (both measured with 
  respective to the bottom wire treated as the ground). This is because right 
  after the switch is closed, the voltage on the left side of $C$ drops from 
  $V_0=2V$ to $V_s=1V$, causing the voltage on its right side to also drop from 
  $0$ to $-1V$, lower than the ground level of $0V$.
\item Voltages on both sides of $C$ go through a discontinuous transition to
  drop (case 1) or jump (case 2) by $V_S-V_0$, however, the voltage $v_C(t)$ 
  remains the same, as the voltage across $C$ does not change instantaneously. 
  $v_R(t)$ drops from $v_R(t)=0$ for $t<0$ to $v_R(t)=V_s-v_c(0)=V_s-V_0$ at 
  $t=0^+$, while $v_C(t)+v_R(t)$ (left side of $C$) drops from $V_0$ to $V_S$.
\end{itemize}

In general, neither the voltage across a capacitor nor the current through
an inductor can be changed instantaneously as it takes time for them to 
build up:
\[
v_C(t)=\frac{1}{C}\int i(t) dt,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;i_C(t)=\frac{1}{L}\int v(t) dtt
\]

{\bf A Shortcut Method:}

Observing the complete solution
\[
v_C(t)=V_s+(V_0-V_s) e^{-t/\tau}	
\]
we see that
\begin{itemize}
\item When $t=0$, $v_C(t)=v_C(0)=V_0$ is the initial condition
\item When $t\rightarrow \infty$, $v_C(t)=v_C(\infty)=V_s$ is the steady 
  state response.
\end{itemize}

We can therefore generalize the complete solution obtained above to all 
first-order systems, i.e., their responses to a step input, a constant input 
that is turned on at moment $t=0$, always take the same form: 
\[
f(t)=f(\infty)+[f(0)-f(\infty)] e^{-t/\tau}	
\]
in terms of three essential components of the system's response:
\begin{itemize}
\item The steady state response $f(\infty)$: as discussed in previous 
  section for steady state response.
\item The initial value $f(0)$: 
  Denote the value of $f(t)$ immediately before and after the moment
  $t=0$ by $f(0_-)$ and $f(0_+)$, respectively. If $f(0_-)\ne f(0_+)$, 
  then use $f(0_+)$ for $f(0)$;
\item the time constant of the system $\tau$: When there is only one 
  resistor in the circuit, the time constant is $\tau=RC$ or $\tau=L/R$.
  When there are multiple resistors, the time constant can be found by:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Remove $C$ or $L$ so that the rest of the circuit ($t>0$) is a 
    one port network.
  \item Find the equivalent resistance $R$ of the network by turning off 
    all energy sources (short-circuit for voltage source, open-circuit 
    for current source).
  \item Find time constant $\tau=RC$ or $\tau=L/R$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In particular, note that
\begin{itemize}
  \item when $t=0$, $f(t)=f(\infty)+f(0)-f(\infty)=f(0)$ the initial condition;
  \item when $t\rightarrow \infty$, $f(t)=f(\infty)$ the {\em steady state response};
  \item when $0 < t < \infty$, the difference $f(0)-f(\infty)$ between the initial 
    and the steady state values of the response decays exponentially. This term is 
    the {\em transient response} of the system.
\end{itemize}

the circuit was in steady state at $t=0$. Find $v_C(t)$ after the switch is closed 
at $t=0$.

\htmladdimg{../figures/BridgeCapacitor.png}

\begin{itemize}
\item Find initial value $v_C(0)$. As the circuit has been in 
  steady state before $t=0$.

  $v_C(0_-)=-5V$, and voltage across $C$ cannot not change 
  instantaneously unless $\tau=0$. At $t=0_+$, $d$ drops from
  $10\,V$ to $0\,V$, $c$ also drops from $5\,V$ to $-5\,V$.
  We have $v_C(0_+)=v_C(0_-)=-5\,V$.

\item Find steady state value $v_C(\infty)$:
  \[	v_C(\infty)=V_{R_2}=V_0\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}=V_0/2=5V	\]
\item Find equivalent resistance $R$:
  \[	R=R_1 || R_2=\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1+R_2}=1\;k\Omega	\]
\item Find time constant 
  \[ \tau=RC=1000\times 0.5\times 10^{-6}=5\times 10^{-4}     \]
\item Find the complete response
  \[	v_C(t)=v_C(\infty)+[v_C(0)-v_C(\infty)]e^{-t/\tau}
  =5+(-5-5) e^{-t/0.0005}=5-10 e^{-2000t}\;(V)	\]
\item Find current $i_C(t)$ through $C$:
  \begin{eqnarray}
    i_C(t)&=&C\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt}=C\frac{d}{dt}(5-10 e^{-t/\tau})
    =C\,\frac{10 e^{-t/\tau}}{\tau}=10 e^{-2000 t}\;(mA)	
    \nonumber \\
    &=&\frac{10 e^{-t/\tau}}{R}=10 e^{-2000 t}\;(mA)	
    \nonumber
  \end{eqnarray}
\item Find voltages $v_1(t)$ and $v_2(t)$ across $R_1$ and $R_2$,
  respectively:
  \[ v_2(t)=v_C(t)=5-10 e^{-2000t}\;(V)	\]
  \[ v_1(t)=V_0-v_C(t)=10-(5-10 e^{-2000t})=5+10 e^{-2000t} \]
\item Find currents $i_1(t)$ and $i_2(t)$ through $R_1$ and $R_2$, 
  respectively:
  \[ i_1(t)=\frac{v_1(t)}{R_1}=2.5+5 e^{-2000t} \; (mA)	\]
  \[ i_2(t)=\frac{v_C(t)}{R_2}=2.5-5 e^{-2000t}\; (mA)	\]
\item Verify current $i_C(t)$:
  \[	i_C(t)=i_1(t)-i_2(t)=10 e^{-2000t} \; (mA)	\]
\end{itemize}

{\bf Example 1a:}

In the same circuit above, find the voltages $v_1(t)$ and $v_2(t)$ 
across and currents $i_1(t)$ and $i_2(t)$ through $R_1$ and $R_2$, 
respectively.

\htmladdimg{../figures/BridgeCapacitor.png}

\begin{itemize}
\item Find $v_1(\infty)=v_2(\infty)=5\;V$
\item Find $v_1(0_+)$ and $v_2(0_+)$. Before $t=0$, the circuit is in
	steady state, i.e., $v_1(0_-)=v_2(0_-)=5\;V$. However, after
	the switch closes at $t=0$, the voltage at node d drops from 
	10V to 0V, and the voltage at node c drops from 5V to -5V with 
	respect to node b as ground (voltage across a capacitor cannot 
	change instantaneously), i.e., $v_1(0_+)=15V$ and $v_2(0_+)=-5V$; 
\item Find $\tau=RC=5\times 10^{-4}$ (same as before);
\item Find $v_1(t)$ and $v_2(t)$:
  \[	v_1(t)=v_1(\infty)+[v_1(0_+)-v_1(\infty)]e^{-t/\tau}
	=5+(15-5)e^{-t/\tau}=5+10e^{-t/\tau}\;V	\]
  \[	v_2(t)=v_2(\infty)+[v_2(0_+)-v_2(\infty)]e^{-t/\tau}
	=5+(-5-5)e^{-t/\tau}=5-10e^{-t/\tau}\;V	\]
	We see that $v_1(t)+v_2(t)=V_0=10V$.
\item Find $i_1(t)$ and $i_2(t)$ through $R_1$ and $R_2$:
  \[	i_1(t)=\frac{v_1(t)}{R_1}=2.5+5e^{-t/\tau}\;mA	\]
  \[	i_2(t)=\frac{v_2(t)}{R_2}=2.5-5e^{-t/\tau}\;mA	\]
\item Find current $i_C(t)$ through capacitor $C$:
  \[    i_C(t)=i_1(t)-i_2(t)=10 e^{-t/\tau}\; mA  \]
\end{itemize}
Note that when $t=0_+$, $v_2(t)=V_c=-5V$, lower than ground voltage $V_b$!

{\bf Example 2}

In the circuit below, $V_0=10\,V$, $R_1=R_2=2\,k\Omega$, $R_3=1\,k\Omega$,
$L=1\,mH$, the circuit was in steady state at $t=0$. Find $i_L(t)$ and 
$v_L(t)$ after the switch is closed at $t=0$.

\htmladdimg{../figures/BridgeL1.png}

\begin{itemize}
\item Find $i_L(0_-)=i_L(0_+)$ (current through an inductor cannot be 
  changed instantaneously):
  \[
  i_L(0_-)=\frac{1}{2}\frac{V_0}{R_1||R_2+R_3}=\frac{10}{2\times2}=2.5\,mA
  \]
\item Find $i_L(\infty)$:
  \[
  i_L(\infty)=-\frac{V_0}{R_2}=-5\,mA
  \]
\item Find $\tau$:
  \[
  R=R_2||R_3=2||1=\frac{2}{3}\;k\Omega,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \tau=\frac{L}{R}=\frac{3\times 10^{-3}}{2\times 10^3}
  =1.5\times 10^{-6}
  \]
\end{itemize}
\[
i_L(t)=i_L(\infty)+[i_L(0)-i_L(\infty)]e^{-t/\tau}=-5+7.5e^{-t/\tau}\;mA
\]
and
\[
v_L(t)=L\frac{di_L(t)}{dt}=-\frac{L}{L/R}7.5e^{-t/\tau}=-R\,7.5e^{-t/\tau}
=-\frac{2}{3}7.5e^{-t/\tau}=-5e^{-t/\tau}\;V
\]
In particular, $v_L(0)=-5\,V$ (note the polarity!)

Also, the currents through $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$ are respectively:
\begin{itemize}
\item $i_1(0_+)=5$, $i_1(\infty)=5$, $i_1(t)=5$
\item $i_2(0_+)=2.5$, $i_2(\infty)=5$, $i_2(t)=5+(2.5-5)e^{-t/\tau}=5-2.5e^{-t/\tau}$
\item $i_3(0_+)=5$, $i_3(\infty)=0$, $i_3(t)=5e^{-t/\tau}$
\end{itemize}
Alternatively we can find
\[
i_3(t)=i_2(t)+i_L(t)=5-2.5e^{-t/\tau}-5+7.5e^{-t/\tau}=5e^{-t/\tau}
\]

{\bf Example 3}

In the circuit below, $V=10\,V$, $R=1\,k\Omega$, $C=1\,\mu F$. The
voltage across $C$ is $v_C(t)=0$ for $t<0$. Switch $S_1$ is closed at $t=0$ 
and switch $S_2$ is closed at $t=1\,ms$. Find $v_C(t)$ for $t>0$.

\htmladdimg{../figures/RC2Switch.png}

\begin{itemize}
\item For $0<t<1\,ms$, $v_C(0)=0$, $v_C(\infty)=10\,V$, and
  $\tau_1=RC=10^{-3}\,sec$, and we get
  \[ 
  v_C(t)=V\,(1-e^{-t/\tau_1})=10(1-e^{-1000\,t})
  \]
  In particular, at $t=1\,ms$, $v_C(10^{-3})=10(1-e^{-1})=6.321$
\item For $1\,ms<t$, $v_C(10^{-1})=6.312$, $v_C(\infty)=5$, 
  $\tau_2=CR/2=0.5\times 10^{-3}=2\times 10^3$
  \[
  v_C(t)=5+(6.321-5)\,e^{-t/\tau_2}=5+1.321 e^{-2000\,t}
  \]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Complete Response II -- Sinusoidal Input}

If the input voltage to the RC circuit considered previously is sinusoidal 
$v(t)=V_s \cos(\omega t+\psi)$, then the DE becomes
\[
v_R(t)+v_C(t)=\tau\frac{d}{dt} v_c(t)+v_c(t)=V_s \cos(\omega t+\psi)	
\]
The homogeneous solution is the same as before $v''_C(t)=A e^{-t/\tau}$.
The particular solution $v'_C(t)$ as the steady state response to $v(t)$ 
can be found by the phasor method. The input is 
\[
v(t)=V_s \cos(\omega t)=Re[\dot{V}\sqrt{2}e^{j\omega t}]	
\]
where $\dot{V}=V_s\; e^{j\psi}/\sqrt{2}$ is the phasor representation of the
voltage. The steady state voltage across
$C$ is (voltage divider)
\begin{eqnarray}
  \dot{V}_C&=&\dot{V} \frac{Z_C}{R+Z_C}
  =\dot{V} \frac{1/j\omega C}{R+1/j\omega C}=\frac{\dot{V}}{j\omega \tau+1}	
  =\frac{\dot{V}}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2+1}\;e^{j\phi}} 
  \nonumber \\
  &=&\frac{\dot{V}\;e^{-j\phi}}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2+1}} 
  =\frac{V_se^{j\psi}\;e^{-j\phi}/\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2+1}} 
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\phi=\tan^{-1} \omega \tau$. In time domain the steady state voltage 
$v'_C(t)$ is:
\[
v'_C(t)=Re\left[\sqrt{2}\dot{V}_C e^{j\omega t} \right]
=Re\left[ \frac{V_s e^{\psi}\;e^{-j\phi} e^{j\omega t}}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2+1}} \right]
= \frac{V_s}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2+1}} \cos(\omega t+\psi-\phi)	
\]
The complete solution is then the sum of both homogeneous and particular
solutions:
\[
v_C(t)=v'_C(t)+v''_C(t)=
\frac{V_s}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2+1}}\cos(\omega t+\psi-\phi)+A e^{-t/\tau} 
\]
From the initial condition $v_C(0)=V_0$, we have
\[
v_C(t)\bigg|_{t=0}=v_C(0)
=V_0=\frac{V_s}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2+1}}\cos(\psi-\phi)+A 
\]
Solving for $A$ we get
\[
A=V_0-\frac{V_s}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2+1}}\cos(\psi-\phi) 
\]
Substituting $A$ back to the expression of $v_C(t)$, we get 
\[
v_C(t)=\frac{V_s}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2+1}}\cos(\omega t+\psi-\phi)+ 
\left[V_0-\frac{V_s}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2+1}}\cos(\psi-\phi)\right] e^{-t/\tau}	
\]
This result can also be generalized for any non-constant input:
\[
f(t)=f_{\infty}(t)+[f(0)-f_{\infty}(0)]e^{-t/\tau} 
\]
also in terms of three essential components
\begin{enumerate}
\item $f(0)$: the initial value (same as before);
\item $f_{\infty}(t)$: the steady state response, $f_{\infty}(0)$ is
  $f_{\infty}(t)$ evaluated at $t=0$;
\item $\tau$: the time constant of the system (same as before).
\end{enumerate}
Note that while the steady state response $f(\infty)$ for the same system 
with a constant input $V_s$ is a constant, here the steady state response 
$f_{\infty}(t)$ is a function of time $t$, but its evaluation at $t=0$ 
$f_{\infty}(0)=f_{\infty}(t)\big|_{t=0}$ is still a constant. We see that the 
complete response is composed of the steady state response and the exponential
decay of the difference between the initial value $f(0)$ and the steady state
response evaluated at $t=0$.

If the initial voltage on $C$ is zero $V_0=0$, then
\[
v_C(t)=\frac{V_s}{\sqrt{(\omega \tau)^2+1}}[\cos(\omega t+\psi-\phi) 
-\cos(\psi-\phi) e^{-t/\tau}]	
\]

Note that the initial magnitude of the transient component varies depending
on the angle $\psi-\phi$. When this angle is either $\pm 90^\circ$, 
$\cos(\psi-\phi)=0$, i.e., the transient component disappears altogether.
However, when $\psi-\phi$ is either $0^\circ$ or $180^\circ$, 
$\cos(\psi-\phi)=\pm 1$, i.e., the magnitude of the transient component 
reaches maximum (either positive or negative), and if $\tau$ value is large
and therefore the transient component decays slowly, the magnitude of the 
initial voltage $v_C(t)$ could be close to three times the peak of steady 
state. The three cases for $\psi-\phi$ to be $0^\circ$, $90^\circ$, and 
$180^\circ$ are shown below:

{\bf Example 2:}

An electromagnet, modeled by a resistor $R=20\Omega$ and $L=0.3H$,
is powered by sinusoidal voltage of $120V$ and $60Hz$. Find the current
through the circuit when the switch is closed at $t=0$ when the phase
angle happens to be $\psi=10^\circ$, i.e., $v(t)=120\sqrt{2}\;
\cos(6.28\times 60 t+10^\circ)$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Find initial value: $i(0)=0$. 
\item Find impedance of circuit:
\[ Z=R+j\omega L=20+j6.28\times 60 \times 0.3=20+j113=114.8\angle{80^\circ}	\]
\item Find steady state value $i_\infty(t)$ by phasor method:
\[
\dot{V}=120 \angle{10^\circ},\;\;\;\;\dot{I}=\frac{\dot{V}}{Z}
=\frac{120\angle{10^\circ}}{114.8\angle{80^\circ}}
=1.05\angle{-70^\circ}	\]
\[ i_\infty(t)=1.05\sqrt{2}\;\cos(6.28\times 60 t -70^\circ) \]
\[ i_\infty(0)=1.05\sqrt{2}\;\cos(-70^\circ)
=1.05\sqrt{2}\times 0.342=0.51	\]
\item Find time constant $\tau=L/R=0.3/20=0.015$.
\item Find current

\subsection*{Second Order Systems}

\htmladdimg{../figures/RCLParallelSeries.png}

The RCL series circuit on the left with input $v(t)$ and output $i(t)$
is described by the following equation:
\[ 
v_R(t)+v_L(t)+v_C(t)=R\,i(t)+L\frac{di(t)}{dt}+\frac{1}{C}\int i(t) dt=v_0(t)
\]
Taking derivative and dividing by $L$ on both sides we get a 2nd-order
linear constant coefficient differential equation (LCCDE):
\[
\ddot{i}(t)+\frac{R}{L}\,\dot{i}(t)+\frac{1}{LC}\,i(t)=\frac{1}{L}\dot{v}_0(t) 
\]
The RCL parallel circuit on the right with input $i(t)$ and output $v(t)$
is described by the following equation:
\[
i_R(t)+i_C(t)+i_L(t)=\frac{v(t)}{R}+C\frac{dv(t)}{dt}+\frac{1}{L}\int v(t)\;dt 
=i_0(t) 
\]
Taking derivative and dividing by $C$ on both sides we get a 2nd-order 
LCCDE:
\[
\ddot{v}(t)+\frac{1}{RC}\,\dot{v}(t)+\frac{1}{LC}\,v(t)=\frac{1}{C}\dot{i}_0(t) 
\]
In general, any 2nd-order LCCDE with input $x(t)$ and output $y(t)$
can be written in the {\em canonical form}
\[ 
\ddot{y}(t)+2\zeta\omega_n\,\dot{y}(t)+\omega_n^2\, y(t)= x(t) 
\]
in terms of two the two parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item the {\em damping coefficient} $\zeta$
\item the {\em natural frequency} $\omega_n$
\end{itemize}
Comparing the canoncal form with two equations above we see that:
\[
\omega_n=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}
\]
and
\[
\frac{R}{L}=2\zeta\omega_n=2\zeta_s\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}},\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;\;
\zeta_s=\frac{R}{2}\sqrt{\frac{C}{L}}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{RC}=2\zeta_p\omega_n=2\zeta_p\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}},\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;\;
\zeta_p=\frac{1}{2R}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}
\]  
Note that we also have:
\[
\zeta_p \zeta_s=\frac{1}{4},\;\;\;\;\;\zeta_p=\frac{1}{4\zeta_s},
\;\;\;\;\;\zeta_s=\frac{1}{4\zeta_p}
\]

\subsubsection*{Particular Solution and Resonance}

If only the steady state response of the system above is of interest, then 
we can ignore the homogeneous solution due to the initial condition and
find only the particular solution due to the input. To do so, we convert
the 2nd order DE into an algebraic equation in terms of the impedances of 
the components. In the following, we consider first the series and then the
parallel systems.

{\bf Series system:} The overall impedance of the three elements is
\[ 
Z=R+j\omega L+\frac{1}{j\omega C}=R+j\left(\omega L-\frac{1}{\omega C}\right)
=|Z|e^{j\angle Z}	
\]
where 
\[ 
|Z|=\sqrt{R^2+\left(\omega L-\frac{1}{\omega C}\right)^2}
=\left\{ \begin{array}{rl} 
\infty & \omega=0\;\; (Z_C=\infty,\;\mbox{capacitive})\\ 
R & \omega=1/\sqrt{LC}\;\; (Z_C+Z_L=0,\;\mbox{resistive})\\
\infty & \omega \rightarrow \infty\;\; (Z_L=\infty,\;\mbox{inductive})
\end{array} \right. 
\]
\[
\angle Z=tan^{-1} \left(\frac{\omega L-1/\omega C}{R}\right)
=\left\{ \begin{array}{rl} -90^\circ & \omega=0\;\; (Z_L=0,\;\mbox{capacitive})\\ 
0^\circ & \omega=1/\sqrt{LC}\;\; (Z_C+Z_L=0,\;\mbox{resistive})\\
90^\circ & \omega \rightarrow \infty\;\; (Z_C=0,\;\mbox{inductive})
\end{array} \right. 
\]

\htmladdimg{../figures/impedanceRCL1.gif}

When the frequency $\omega$ is the same as the {\em natural frequency}
defined as
\[
\omega_n\stackrel{\triangle}{=}\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}	
\]
the impedances of the capacitor and the inductor have the same magnitude 
but opposite phase, and they add up to zero:
\[
Z_L=j\omega_nL=j\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}},\;\;\;\;\;\;
Z_C=\frac{1}{j\omega_nC}=-j\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}},\;\;\;\;\;
Z_L+Z_C=0
\]
Now the total impedance is real and minimized (admittance is maximized):
\[
Z=Z_R+Z_C+Z_L=Z_R=R 
\] 
and the current $\dot{I}=\dot{V}/Z=\dot{V}/R$ is maximized. Also, as
$\angle Z=0$, the current $\dot{I}$ and voltage $\dot{V}$ are in phase. 

The {\em quality factor} of this series RCL 2nd order system is defined as
\[
Q_s=\frac{\mbox{magnitude of inductor/capacitor impedance at $\omega_n$}}{R}
\]
i.e.,
\begin{eqnarray}
  Q_s&\stackrel{\triangle}{=}&\frac{|Z_L|}{R}=\frac{\omega_nL}{R}
  =\frac{L}{R\sqrt{LC}}
  \nonumber \\
  &=&\frac{|Z_C|}{R}=\frac{1}{\omega_nCR}=\frac{\sqrt{LC}}{RC}
  \nonumber \\
  &=&\frac{1}{R}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}=\frac{1}{2\zeta_s}
  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

When $\omega=\omega_n=1/\sqrt{LC}$, the voltages across the three 
components are:
\[
\dot{V}_R=\dot{I} Z_R =\frac{\dot{V}}{R} \;R=\dot{V}
\]
\[ 
\dot{V}_L=\dot{I} Z_L=\frac{\dot{V}}{R}\;j\omega_n L
=j\frac{\dot{V}}{R}\;\frac{L}{\sqrt{LC}}
=j\,\dot{V} \frac{1}{R}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}=jQ_s\dot{V}	
\]
\[ 
\dot{V}_C=\dot{I} Z_C=\frac{\dot{V}}{R}\;\frac{1}{j\omega_n C}
=-j\,\frac{\dot{V}}{R}\;\frac{\sqrt{LC}}{C}
=-j\,\dot{V}\;\frac{1}{R}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}=-jQ_s\dot{V}	
\]
We see that 
\begin{itemize}
\item The voltage across $R$ is equal to the source voltage: $\dot{V}_R=\dot{V}$;
\item The voltages across $L$ and $C$ have the same magnitude, which is $Q_s$ 
  times the voltage across $R$: $|\dot{V}_L|=|\dot{V}_C|=Q_s\dot{V}_R$
\item The voltage across $L$ and $C$ have opposite phases: $\angle V_L=-\angle V_C$.
  We therefore see that $\dot{V}_L=-\dot{V}_C$, i.e., $V_L$ and $V_C$ have opposite
  polarities and they cancel each other.
\end{itemize}

The impedance $Z=Z_R+R_L+Z_C$ as a function of $\omega$ is shown below:

and the admittances $Y=1/Z$ for different $Q$ ($R$) and $C$ are shown below.
The bandpass effect can be intuitively explained. When $\omega$ is high,
the inductor's impedance $\omega L$ is high, and when $\omega$ is low,
the capacitor's impedance $1/\omega C$ is high. When $\omega=\omega_n$
the overall impedance is the smallest. If the input is a voltage source 
$v(t)$, the current through the circuit will reach a maximum value when 
$\omega=\omega_n$.

{\bf Example: } In a series RLC circuit, $R=5\Omega$, $L=4\;mH$ and
$C=0.1\;\mu F$. The natural frequency $\omega_n$ can be found to be
$\omega_n=1/\sqrt{LC}=1/\sqrt{4\times 10^{-3}\times 10^{-7}}=5\times 10^4$.
The quality factor is
\[	
Q_s=\frac{\omega_nL}{R}=\frac{(5\times 10^4)\times (4\times 10^{-3})}{5}
=40	
\]
or
\[
Q_s=\frac{1}{\omega_nCR}=\frac{1}{(5\times 10^4)\times 10^{-7}\times 5}
=40	
\]
If the input voltage is $V_{rms}=10V$ at the natural frequency, the current
is $I=V/R=10/5=2 A$, and the voltages across each of the elements are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\dot{V}_R=R\dot{I}=V=10V$
\item $\dot{V}_L=j\omega L \dot{I}=j5\times 10^4\times 4\times 10^{-3} \times 2=j400V=jQ_sV$
\item $\dot{V}_C=\dot{I}/j\omega_nC=-j2/(5\times 10^4\times 0.1\times 10^{-6})=-j400V=-jQ_sV$
\end{itemize}
Note that although input voltage is $10V$, the voltage across L and C ($Q$ 
times the input) could be very high, but they are in opposite phase and 
therefore cancel each other).


{\bf Parallel system:} 

\htmladdimg{../figures/impedanceRCL2.gif}

The overall admittance of the three elements in parallel is
\[ 
Y=G+j\omega C+\frac{1}{j\omega L}=G+j\left(\omega C-\frac{1}{\omega L}\right)
=|Y|e^{j\angle Y}	
\]
where
\[
|Y|=\sqrt{G^2+\left(\omega C-\frac{1}{\omega L}\right)^2},\;\;\;\;
\angle Y=tan^{-1} \left(\frac{\omega C-1/\omega L}{G}\right) 
\]
In particular when $\omega$ is at the {\em natural frequency}
\[
\omega_n\stackrel{\triangle}{=}\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}	
\]
we have $\omega C=1/\omega L$, and the total admittance is minimized
(impedance is maximized):
\[ 
Y=Y_R+Y_C+Y_L=G+j\left(\omega C-\frac{1}{\omega L}\right)=G 
\]
and the voltage $\dot{V}=\dot{I}/Y=\dot{I}/G$ is maximized. Also, as 
$\angle Y=0$, the voltage $\dot{V}$ and current $\dot{I}$ are in phase.

The {\em quality factor} $Q_p$ of this parallel RCL 2nd order system is 
defined as
\[
Q_p=\frac{\mbox{magnitude of inductor/capacitor susceptance at $\omega_n$}}{G}
\]
i.e.,
\begin{eqnarray}
  Q_p&\stackrel{\triangle}{=}&\frac{|Y_L|}{G}=\frac{1}{\omega_nLG}
  =\frac{\sqrt{LC}}{LG}
  \nonumber \\
  &=&\frac{|Y_C|}{G}=\frac{\omega_n C}{G}=\frac{C}{\sqrt{LC}G}
  \nonumber \\
  &=&R\sqrt{\frac{C}{L}}=\frac{1}{2\zeta_p}
  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
We note that $Q_p$ of the parallel RCL circuit is the reciprocal of $Q_s$ of
the series RCL circuit:
\[ 
\frac{1}{Q_s}=Q_p,\;\;\;\;\;\;\frac{1}{Q_p}=Q_s
\]
When $\omega=\omega_n=1/\sqrt{LC}$, the voltage is 
$\dot{V}=\dot{I}/Y=\dot{I}/G=\dot{I}R$
and the currents through the three components are:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\[
\dot{I}_R=\dot{V}Y_R=\dot{V}G=\frac{\dot I}{G} G=\dot{I},
\]
\item 
\[
\dot{I}_C=\dot{V} Y_C=\dot{I}R\;j\omega_n C=j\dot{I}R\frac{C}{\sqrt{LC}}
=j \dot{I} R\;\sqrt{\frac{C}{L}}=jQ\dot{I}	
\]
\item 
\[
\dot{I}_L=\dot{V} Y_L=\dot{I}R\;\frac{1}{j\omega_n L}
=-j\dot{I}R\frac{\sqrt{LC}}{L}=-j \dot{I} R\;\sqrt{\frac{C}{L}}=-jQ\dot{I}	
\]
\end{itemize}
We see that 
\begin{itemize}
\item The current through $R$ is equal to the source current: $\dot{I}_R=\dot{I}$;
\item The currents through $L$ and $C$ have the same magnitude, which is $Q_p$ 
  times the current through $R$: $|\dot{I}_L|=|\dot{I}_C|=Q_p\dot{I}_R$
\item The currents through $L$ and $C$ have opposite phases:
  $\angle I_L=-\angle I_C$. We therefore see that $\dot{I}_L=-\dot{I}_C$, i.e.,
  $I_L$ and $I_C$ have opposite directions, they form a loop current through $L$
  and $C$.
\end{itemize}

The concept of the quality factor $Q$ of a second order RCL circuit can
be generalized to describe any second or higher order system. Specifically,
we define the quality factor of a system as the ratio between the energy 
stored in the system and the energy dissipated by the system. 
\[
Q=2\pi\frac{\mbox{maximum energy stored}}{\mbox{energy dissipated per cycle}}
\]
In the specific case of the series RCL circuit, this is the ratio between 
the energy stored in $C$ and $L$ and the energy dissipated by $R$ at the 
natural frequency $\omega=\omega_n=1/\sqrt{LC}$. Consider the maximum energy
stored in $L$:
\[	
W_L=\int_0^T i(t)\; v(t) dt=\int_0^T i(t) L \frac{di(t)}{dt} dt
=L \int_0^{I_p} i \;di=\frac{1}{2}LI_p^2=LI^2_{rms}	
\]
and the maximum energy stored in $C$:
\[
W_C=\int_0^T v(t)\; i(t) dt=\int_0^T v(t) C \frac{dv(t)}{dt} dt
=C \int_0^{V_p} v \;dv=\frac{1}{2}CV_p^2=CV^2_{rms}	
\]
where $I_p=\sqrt{2}I_{rms}$ is the peak current through $L$, and
$V_p=\sqrt{2}V_{rms}$ is the peak voltage across $C$. At natural frequency
$\omega_n=1/\sqrt{LC}$, the voltages across $C$ and $L$ are the same, we
have $|V_C|=V_{rms}=|V_L|$, and 
\[
W_L=LI^2_{rms}=L \left( \frac{V_{rms}}{\omega_nL}\right)^2
=L\frac{V^2_{rms}LC}{L^2}=CV^2_{rms}=W_C 
\]
This result indicates the fact that the energy $W_L=W_C$ is converted back 
and forth between magnetic energy in $L$ and electrical energy in $C$.
The energy dissipated in $R$ per cycle $T_0=2\pi/\omega_n=1/f_0$ is:
\[
W_R=T_0\;P_R = T_0\;I^2_{rms} R 
\]
Following the definition of $Q$ above, we have
\[
Q=2\pi\frac{W_L}{W_R}=2\pi\frac{LI^2_{rms}}{T_0I^2_{rms}R }
=2\pi f_0\frac{L}{R}=\frac{\omega_nL}{R}=\frac{1}{\omega_nCR}
\]
which is indeed the same as the $Q$ defined before.

The quality factor $Q$ and the damping coefficient $\zeta$ are inversely
related to each other:
\[
Q_p=\frac{1}{2\zeta_p},\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{and}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
Q_s=\frac{1}{2\zeta_s}
\]
The quality factor can also be used to judge whether a second order system 
is under, critically or over damped. Qualitatively, a greater $Q$ or a smaller
$\zeta$ indicates that the system is energetic, active, and responsive, while 
on the other hand, a smaller $Q$ or a greater $\zeta$ indicates that the
system is sluggish, inactive, and unresponsive. 

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c} \hline 
$\zeta<1$ & $Q>0.5$ & under damped \\
$\zeta=1$ & $Q=0.5$ & critically damped \\
$\zeta>1$ & $Q<0.5$ & over damped \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

As the quality factor can be more generally defined in terms of the ratio of 
the energy stored and dissipated in the system, it can be used to characterize
systems in a more general sense than just 2nd order systems.

\subsubsection*{Homogeneous Solution}

Applying the KVL to an RCL series circuit we get
\[ 
v_L(t)+v_R(t)+v_C(t)=v(t) 
\]
where $v(t)$ on the right-hand side is the input voltage. As
\[ 
v_R(t)=R\;i(t)=R\,C\frac{d\,v_C(t)}{dt},\;\;\;\;\;\;
v_L(t)=L\frac{d}{dt}i(t)=L\frac{d}{dt}\left[C\frac{d\,v_C(t)}{dt} \right]
=LC\frac{d^2\,v_C(t)}{dt^2}
\]
the equation above can be written as a 2nd order ODE in terms of $v_C(t)$:
\[ 
LC\frac{d^2}{dt^2}v_C(t)+RC\frac{d}{dt}v_C(t)+v_C(t)=v(t) 
\]
Dividing both sides by $LC$ we get
\[ 
\frac{d^2}{dt^2}v_C(t)+\frac{R}{L}\frac{d}{dt}v_C(t)+\frac{1}{LC}v_C(t)
=\frac{1}{LC}v(t)
\]
If we let
\[
\omega_n=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}},\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\zeta=\frac{R}{2}\sqrt{\frac{C}{L}}
\]
the DE above can be written in canonical form 
\[
\ddot{v}_C(t)+2\zeta\omega_n\;\dot{v}_C(t)+\omega_n^2\;v_C(t)
=\ddot{v}_C(t)+\triangle\omega\;\dot{v}_C(t)+\omega_n^2\;v_C(t)=\omega_n^2v(t) 
\]
in terms of the damping coefficient $\zeta$ and the natural frequency 
$\omega_n$. In the following we consider solving this 2nd order DE in its
most general form:
\[
\ddot{y}(t)+2\zeta\omega_n\dot{y}(t)+\omega_n^2 y(t)=x(t) 
\]
When the input $x(t)=0$, the right hand side of the DE is zero and the 
equation is homogeneous. Substituting the assumed solution $v_C(t)=Ae^{st}$ 
into the DE we get
\[
(s^2+2\zeta\omega_n s+\omega_n^2)Ae^{st}=0 
\]
As we are not interested in a trivial or zero solutioin, $Ae^{st}\ne 0$, we
get an algebraic equation
\[ 
s^2+2\zeta\omega_n s+\omega_n^2=0 
\]
The discriminant of this quadratic equation is 
\[
\Delta=(2\zeta\omega_n)^2-4\omega_n^2=4\omega_n^2(\zeta^2-1)
\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\ge 0 & |\zeta|\ge 1\\< 0 & |\zeta|< 1\end{array}\right.
\]
and the two roots are
\[ 
s_{1,2}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\left(-\zeta\pm\sqrt{\zeta^2-1}\right)\omega_n
&|\zeta|\ge 1\\
\left(-\zeta\pm j\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}\right)\omega_n=\omega_n e^{\mp j\phi} 
&|\zeta|< 1\end{array}\right.
\]
where
\[
\phi=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}{\zeta}\right) 
\]

\htmladdimg{../figures/zetaphi.png}

For a fixed value of $\omega_n$ and a changing value of $\zeta$ that changes 
from $-\infty$ to $\infty$, the two roots $s_1$ (red) and $s_2$ (blue) can be
represented as the root locus on the complex plane.

\htmladdimg{../rootlocus2nd1.gif}

In particular, for the RCL circuit with all $R$, $C$, and $L$ values 
non-negative, we have $\zeta\ge 0$, i.e., we only need to consider the 
root locus on the left side of the complex plain.

Given the two roots $s_1$ and $s_2$, we can write the homogeneous solution as
\[
y_h(t)=C_1 e^{s_1t}+C_2 e^{s_2t} 
\]
where the two coefficients $C_1$ and $C_2$ can be found based on the two initial
conditions $y(0)$ and $\dot{y}(0)$. If we assume $\dot{y}(0)=0$ but $y(0)=y_0$,
then we get
\begin{eqnarray}
  y(0)&=&y_h(t)\bigg|_{t=0}=C_1+C_2=y_0  \nonumber \\
  \dot{y}(0)&=&\dot{y}_h(t)\bigg|_{t=0}=s_1C_1+s_2C_2=0 \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Solving these we get
\[ C_1=\frac{s_2}{s_2-s_1} y_0,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;C_2=\frac{s_1}{s_1-s_2} y_0 \]
and the homogeneous solution becomes:
\[ y_h(t)=y_0 \left[ \frac{s_2 e^{s_1t}}{s_2-s_1}+\frac{s_1 e^{s_2t}}{s_1-s_2} \right] \]

The solution takes different forms depending on the value of the damping coefficient $\zeta$.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Over-damped system ($\zeta>1$)}
  \begin{eqnarray}
    y_h(t)&=&y_0 \left[ \frac{s_2 e^{s_1t}}{s_2-s_1}+\frac{s_1 e^{s_2t}}{s_1-s_2} \right]
    \nonumber \\
    &=&y_0\left[\frac{-\zeta+\sqrt{\zeta^2-1}}{2\sqrt{\zeta^2-1}}e^{(-\zeta-\sqrt{\zeta^2-1})\omega_nt}
      -\frac{-\zeta-\sqrt{\zeta^2-1}}{2\sqrt{\zeta^2-1}}e^{(-\zeta+\sqrt{\zeta^2-1})\omega_nt}\right]
    \nonumber 
  \end{eqnarray}
  This is a sum of two exponentially decaying terms, without any overshoot or oscillation.
  Note that when $t=0$, $y_h=y_0$. 

\item {\bf Critically damped system ($\zeta=1$)}

  Now we have
  \[ s_1=s_2=-\omega_n=s \]
  and the homogeneous solution takes form of
  \begin{eqnarray}
    y_h(t)&=&C_1 e^{st}+C_2 t e^{st}=C_1 e^{-\omega_nt}+C_2 t e^{-\omega_nt} 
    \nonumber \\
    \dot{y}_h(t)&=&\frac{d}{dt}[C_1 e^{st}+C_2 t e^{st}]=C_1se^{st}+C_2(e^{st}+ste^{st})  
    \nonumber 
  \end{eqnarray}
  Applying the initial conditions to this response we can get
  \begin{eqnarray}
    y(0)&=&C_1=y_0  \nonumber \\
    \dot{y}(0)&=&s C_1+C_2=0 \nonumber 
  \end{eqnarray}
  Solving this we get 
  \[ 
  C_1=y_0, \;\;\;\;\;\;\;C_2=y_0
  \]
  and the response is
  \[ y_h(t)=C_1 e^{st}+C_2 t e^{st}=y_0\left[ e^{-\omega_nt}+\omega_n t e^{-\omega_nt}\right] \]
  Again, there is no overshoot or oscillation.
\item {\bf Under-damped system ($0 \le \zeta < 1$)}
  \[ s_{1,2}=(-\zeta\pm j \sqrt{1-\zeta^2})\omega_n=-\zeta\omega_n\pm j\omega_d,\;\;\;\;\mbox{and}\;\;\;\;
  s_1-s_2=2j\omega_d  \]
  where $\omega_d$ is the {\em damped natural frequency} defined as:
  \[ \omega_d=\omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2} \]
  The response is
  \begin{eqnarray}
    y_h(t)&=&y_0 \left[ \frac{s_2 e^{s_1t}}{s_2-s_1}+\frac{s_1 e^{s_2t}}{s_1-s_2} \right]
    \nonumber \\
    &=&y_0\left[ \frac{(-\zeta-j\sqrt{1-\zeta^2})\omega_n}{-2j\omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}} e^{(-\zeta\omega_n+j\omega_d)t}
                +\frac{(-\zeta+j\sqrt{1-\zeta^2})\omega_n}{-2j\omega_n\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}} e^{(-\zeta\omega_n-j\omega_d)t} \right]
    \nonumber \\
    &=&y_0\frac{e^{-\zeta\omega_nt}}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}} \left(\frac{e^{j\phi}e^{j\omega_dt}-e^{-j\phi}e^{-j\omega_dt}}{2j}\right)
    =y_0\frac{e^{-\zeta\omega_nt}}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}} \sin(\omega_dt+\phi)
    \nonumber
  \end{eqnarray}
  Here we have defined:
  \[ 
  \phi=\tan^{-1}\left( \frac{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}{\zeta} \right),\;\;\;\;\;
  \zeta+j\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}=e^{j\phi},\;\;\;\;\;\zeta-j\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}=e^{-j\phi}
  \]
\item {\bf Undamped system ($ \zeta =0$)}
  \[ s_1=j\omega_n,\;\;\;\;\;\;s_2=-j\omega_n \]
  \[ y_h(t)=y_0 \left[ \frac{s_2 e^{s_1t}}{s_2-s_1}+\frac{s_1 e^{s_2t}}{s_1-s_2} \right]
  =y_0\left(\frac{e^{j\omega_n}+e^{-j\omega_n}}{2}\right)=y_0\cos(\omega_nt) \]
  This result can also be obtained from the previous case:
  \[ \lim_{\zeta\leftarrow 0} \left(y_0\frac{e^{-\zeta\omega_nt}}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}} \sin(\omega_dt+\phi) \right)
  =y_0\sin(\omega_nt+\frac{\pi}{2})=y_0\cos(\omega_nt) \]
\end{itemize}

The homogeneous responses of these four cases are plotted below. Note that in all cases,
$y(0)=y_0$ and $\dot{y}(0)=0$.

\subsubsection*{Complete Solution with Step Input}

We next consider the complete solution (composed of both homogeneous and 
particular solutions) of the 2nd order DE
\[
\ddot{y}(t)+2\zeta\omega_n\dot{y}(t)+\omega_n^2 y(t)=x(t) 
\]
with a unit step $x(t)=u(t)$ input and zero initial conditions 
$y(0)=\dot{y}(0)=0$. As the input is a constant for $t>0$, we can assume the 
particular solution to be a constant $y_p(t)=C$. Substituting this $y_p(t)$ 
into the DE above, we get $y_p(t)=C=1/\omega_n^2$, i.e., the steady state 
solution is:
\[
y_{ss}(t)=y_p(t)=y(\infty)=\frac{1}{\omega_n^2} 
\]
The complete response can be obtained as the sum of the homogeneous solution
(same as that obtained previously) and particular solution, corresponding to 
the transient and steady state response, respectively:
\[
y(t)=y_h(t)+y_p(t)=C_1 e^{s_1t}+C_2 e^{s_2t}+\frac{1}{\omega_n^2} 
\]
The two coefficients $C_1$ and $C_2$ can be obtained based on the two zero initial
conditions:
\begin{eqnarray}
  y(0)&=&y(t)\bigg|_{t=0}=C_1+C_2+\frac{1}{\omega_n^2}=0 
  \nonumber \\
  \dot{y}(0)&=&\dot{y}(t)\bigg|_{t=0}=C_1s_1+C_2s_2=0 
  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Solving these equations we get:
\[
C_1=\frac{s_2}{\omega_n^2(s_1-s_2)}=\frac{-s_2}{\omega_n^2(s_2-s_1)},
\;\;\;\;\;\;C_2=\frac{s_1}{\omega_n^2(s_2-s_1)} 
\]
Now the complete solution becomes:
\[
y(t)=\frac{1}{\omega_n^2}\left[1-\left(\frac{s_2}{s_2-s_1}e^{s_1t}
  -\frac{s_1}{s_2-s_1}e^{s_2t}\right)\right] 
\]
The two roots $s_1$ and $s_2$ take different forms depending on 
whether the discriminant $\Delta=4\omega_n^2(\zeta^2-1)$ is greater
or smaller than 0, i.e., whether $\zeta$ is greater or smaller then 1.
Here we only consider the case when $0 < \zeta < 1$, i.e., $\Delta<0$,
for an under-damped second order system. The two roots are
\[
s_{1,2}=\omega_n \; (-\zeta\pm j\sqrt{1-\zeta^2})=-\zeta \omega_n\pm j\omega_d,
\;\;\;\;\mbox{and}\;\;\;\;s_2-s_1=-2j\omega_d 
\]
where $\omega_d$ is the damped natural frequency:
\[
\omega_d=\omega_n \sqrt{1-\zeta^2} 
\]
Finally the complete solution of the non-homogeneous DE is:
\begin{eqnarray}
  y(t)&=&\frac{1}{\omega_n^2}\left[1-\left(\frac{s_2}{s_2-s_1}e^{s_1t}-\frac{s_1}{s_2-s_1}e^{s_2t}\right)\right]
  \nonumber \\
  &=&\frac{1}{\omega_n^2}\left[ 1-
    \left(\frac{\zeta+j\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}{2j\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}} e^{(-\zeta\omega_n+j\omega_d)t} 
    -\frac{\zeta-j\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}{2j\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}} e^{(-\zeta\omega_n-j\omega_d)t} \right) \right]
  \nonumber \\
  &=&\frac{1}{\omega_n^2}\left[ 1-\frac{e^{-\zeta\omega_nt}}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}
    \left(\frac{\zeta+j\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}{2j} e^{ j\omega_dt} 
    -\frac{\zeta-j\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}{2j} e^{-j\omega_dt} \right) \right]
  \nonumber \\
  &=&\frac{1}{\omega_n^2}\left[ 1-\frac{e^{-\zeta\omega_nt}}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}
    \left(\frac{ e^{j\phi} e^{ j\omega_dt}-e^{-j\phi} e^{-j\omega_dt} }{2j} \right) \right]
  \nonumber \\
  &=&\frac{1}{\omega_n^2}\left[1-\frac{e^{-\zeta\omega_nt}}{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}
    \sin(\omega_dt+\phi) \right]
  \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
where 
\[ \phi=\tan^{-1}\left( \frac{\sqrt{1-\zeta^2}}{\zeta} \right),\;\;\;\;\mbox{and}\;\;\;\;
\sin \phi=\sqrt{1-\zeta^2},\;\;\;\;\cos \phi=\zeta  \]

\htmladdimg{../figures/zetaphi.png}

In particular, if $\zeta=0$, we have
\[
y(t)=\frac{1}{\omega_n^2}\left[1-\sin(\omega_n t+\pi/2)\right]
=\frac{1}{\omega_n^2}\left[1-\cos(\omega_n t)\right]
\]

The plots below shows an example with $f_n=1, \omega_n=2\pi$. Note the critical 
damped case when $\zeta=1$. An overshoot will occur for any $\zeta<1$.

The step response is plotted below. Note that $y(0)=0$ and $\dot{y}(0)=0$.

{\bf Example} 

Consider the response $y(t)=v_C(t)$ of an undamped 2nd order RCL system.

\begin{itemize}
\item Find the response $y(t)$ of the RLC circuit to a step input $x(t)=Vu(t)$.
  The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution 
  $A\sin\omega_nt+B\cos\omega_nt$ and the particular solution $V$:
  \[ y(t)=V+A\sin(\omega_nt)+B\cos(\omega_nt),\;\;\;\;\;\;\;t>0 \]
  Consider two different sets of initial conditions:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Zero initial conditions $y(0)=\dot{y}(0)=0$. We have $y(0)=V+B=0$ 
    and $\dot{y}(0)=A\omega_n=0$, and
    \[ y(t)=V+A\sin(\omega_nt)+B\cos(\omega_nt)=V[1-\cos(\omega_nt)] \]
  \item $y(0)=V$, $\dot{y}=0$. We have $y(0)=V+B=V$ and $\dot{y}(0)=A\omega_n=0$, 
    i.e., $A=B=0$ and
    \[ y(t)=V+A\sin(\omega_nt)+B\cos(\omega_nt)=V \]
  \end{itemize}
  

\item Find the system's response to a square impulse 
  \[ x(t)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}1 & 0\le t< t_0 \\0 & \mbox{else} 
  \end{array} \right. \]
  As $x(t)=u(t)-u(t-t_0)$, the response is
  \[ y(t)=[1-\cos(\omega_nt)]u(t)-[1-\cos(\omega_n(t-t_0))]u(t-t_0) \]
  When $t>t_0$, we have
  \[ y(t)=\cos(\omega_n(t-t_0))-\cos(\omega_nt) \]
  We further consider two special cases. 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When $t_0=T=2\pi/\omega_n$, we have 
    \begin{eqnarray}
      y(t)&=&[1-\cos(\omega_nt)]u(t)-[1-\cos(\omega_n(t-T))]u(t-T)
      \nonumber \\
      &=&\left\{\begin{array}{cl} 1-\cos(\omega_nt) & 0<t<T \\ 0 & \mbox{else}
      \end{array} \right. 
      \nonumber 
    \end{eqnarray}
    This is a one period of a sinusoid.
  \item When $t_0=T/2=\pi/\omega_n$, we have
    \begin{eqnarray}
      y(t)&=&[1-\cos(\omega_nt)]u(t)-[1-\cos(\omega_n(t-T/2))]u(t-T/2)
      \nonumber \\
      &=&[1-\cos(\omega_nt)]u(t)-[1+\cos(\omega_nt)]u(t-T/2)
      \nonumber \\
      &=&\left\{\begin{array}{cl}1-\cos(\omega_nt) & 0<t<T/2 \\
      -2\cos(\omega_nt) & t>T/2 \end{array} \right.
      \nonumber 
    \end{eqnarray}
    This is a pure sinusoid after $t>T/2$.
  \end{itemize}

\item Find the impulse response $h(t)$. The input $x(t)$ is an impulse which
  can be written as
  \[ x(t)=\delta(t)=\lim_{t_0\rightarrow 0}\left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
    1/t_0 & 0\le t< t_0 \\0 & \mbox{else} \end{array}\right. \]
  When $t_0\rightarrow 0$, we have first order approximations 
  $\cos(\omega_nt_0)\approx 1$ and $\sin(\omega_nt_0)\approx \omega_nt_0$, 
  and we get
  \[ \cos(\omega_n(t-t_0))=\cos(\omega_nt)\;\cos(\omega_nt_0)+\sin(\omega_nt)\;
  \sin(\omega_nt_0)  \approx\cos(\omega_nt)+\sin(\omega_nt)\,\omega_nt_0 \]
  Substituting this into $y(t)=\cos(\omega_n(t-t_0))-\cos(\omega_nt)$
  we get the impulse response 
  \[ y(t)=\omega_n\sin(\omega_nt) \]
  
\item It is often desirable for a second order system to reach a set steady 
  state value without overshoot. This can be achieved by drive the system 
  by an impulse $\delta(t)/\omega_n$ with response $\sin(\omega_nt)$, followed 
  by a step $u(t-T/4)$ with response 
  \[ [1-\cos(\omega_n(t-T/4))]u(t-T/4)=[1-\cos(\omega_nt-\pi/2)]u(t-T/4)
  =[1-\sin(\omega_nt)]u(t-T/4) \]
  The total response is
  \[ y(t)=\sin(\omega_nt)u(t)+[1-\sin(\omega_nt)]u(t-T/4)
  =\left\{\begin{array}{cl} \sin(\omega_nt) & 0<t<T/4 \\
  1 & t>T/4\end{array} \right. \]
  We see that after $y(t)$ reaches the first peak of $1$ at $t=T/4$, it will
  stay at the constant value $1$ as the two responses cancel each other for
  $t>T/4$.

\item Alternatively, the steady state value $v=1$ can be achieved without
  overshoot by applying an input $x(t)=[u(t)-u(t-T/2)]/2$. The response to 
  $u(t)/2$ is 
  \[ \frac{1}{2}[1-\cos(\omega_nt)]u(t) \]
  while the response to $u(t-T/2)/2$ is  
  \[ \frac{1}{2}[1-\cos(\omega_n(t-T/2))]u(t-T/2)
  =\frac{1}{2}[1-\cos(\omega_nt-\pi)]u(t-T/2)
  =\frac{1}{2}[1+\cos(\omega_nt)]u(t-T/2) \]
  The overall response is the difference between the two individual responses:
  \[ y(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}
     [1-\cos\omega_nt]/2 & 0<t<T/2 \\ 1 & t>T/2 \end{array} \right. 
  \]
  i.e., the response is $y(t)=1$ for all $t>T/2$.

\item It is desirable for a second order system to reach a steady state value
  $y(t)=1$ within a time delay $t_0$ without overshoot. We first consider 
  driving the system with a positive square pulse of value $V>0$ followed
  by a negative one of $(1-a)V<0$:
  \[ x(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl} 
  V & (0<t<t_0/2) \\ (1-a)V & (t_0/2<t<t_0)
  \end{array}\right.  =V \left[u(t)-a u(t-t_0/2)\right]  \]
  The response for $t_0/2<t<t_0$ is:
  \[ y(t)=V\left[ 1-\cos(\omega_nt)-a[1-\cos(\omega_n(t-t_0/2))]\right] \]
  In order for the output to be a constant $y(t)=1$ for $t>t_0$, we need to 
  have the input $x(t)=1$ for $t>t_0$, and set the initial conditions at $t=t_0$
  to be $y(t_0)=1$ and $\dot{y}(t_0)=0$. To do so, we let
  \[ \frac{dy(t)}{dt}\bigg|_{t=t_0}=V\omega_n\left[ \sin(\omega_nt)
    -a\sin(\omega_n(t-t_0/2))\right]_{t=t_0}
  =V\omega_n\left[ \sin(\omega_nt_0)-a\sin(\omega_nt_0/2)\right]=0 
  \]
  Based on the trigonometric identity 
  $\sin(\omega_nt_0)=2\sin(\omega_nt_0/2)\cos(\omega_nt_0/2)$, the equation above 
  can be written as
  \[ 2\cos(\omega_nt_0/2) =a \]
  Substituting this into the desired initial condition $y(t_0)=1$, we get
  \[ y(t_0)=V\left[ 1-\cos(\omega_nt_0)-2\cos(\omega_nt_0/2)
    [1-\cos(\omega_n(t_0/2))]\right] 
  =2V(1-\cos(\omega_nt_0/2) =4V\sin^2(\omega_nt_0/4)=1 \]
  where we have used the trigonometric identities
  $2\cos^2(\omega_nt_0/2)=1+\cos(\omega_nt_0)$ and
  $2\sin^2(\omega_nt_0/4)=1-\cos(\omega_nt_0/2)$. Solving this for $V$ we get
  \[ V=\frac{1}{4\sin^2(\omega_nt_0/4)} \]
  As now we have the initial conditions $y(t_0)=1$ and $\dot{y}(t_0)=0$ as 
  needed. If we set $x(t)=1$ for $t>t_0$, so that the output will be at 
  constant $y(t)=1$ when $t>t_0$.

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Responses to Impulse Train}

{\bf Example 1}

Consider the steady state response of a first order RC circuit with the
parameter $\tau$ to a square impulse train of period $T$:
\[
x(t+T)=x(t)=\left\{ \begin{array}{cl}1&0<t<T_0\\0&T_0<t<T\end{array}\right.
\]
where $T_0$ is the on-time and $T_1=T-T_0$ is off-time of the impulse train.
Consider the response $y(t)=v_C(t)$ during both the on and off periods:
\begin{itemize}
\item The on-time response can be found based on the assumed initial condition 
  $y(t)\big|_{t=0}=V_0$:
  \[ y(t)=1+(V_0-1)e^{-t/\tau},\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(0<t<T_0) \]
  In particular, $y(t)\big|_{t=T_0}=y(T_0)=1+(V_0-1)e^{-T_0/\tau}=V_1$  
\item The off-time response can be found based on the initial condition
  $y(T_0)=V_1$ to be
  \[ y(t)=0+(V_1-0)e^{-(t-T_0)/\tau}=V_1 e^{-(t-T_0)/\tau},\;\;\;\;\;\;(T_0<t<T) \]
  In particular, $y(T)=y(0)=V_1 e^{-(T-T_0)/\tau}=V_1 e^{-T_1/\tau}=V_0$
\end{itemize}
The two voltages $V_0$ and $V_1$ can then be found by solving these two 
simultaneous equations:
\[ 
\left\{\begin{array}{l} V_0=V_1 e^{-T_1/\tau}\\V_1=1+(V_0-1)e^{-T_0/\tau}\end{array}\right. 
\]
Substituting the first equation into the second one we can find $V_1$ and then
$V_0$:
\[
V_1=\frac{1-e^{-T_0/\tau}}{1-e^{-T/\tau}},\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
V_0=\frac{e^{-T_1/\tau}-e^{-T/\tau}}{1-e^{-T/\tau}} 
\]
Consider two special cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item When $T_0\gg\tau$ and $T_1\gg\tau$, all exponential terms become zero 
  and we have $V_0=0$ and $V_1=1$, i.e., the capacitor is fully charged and
  then fully discharged.
\item When $T_0\ll\tau$ and $T_1\ll\tau$, all exponential terms can be 
  approximated by $e^{-x}\approx 1-x$, and we have:
  \[ V_1=\frac{1-e^{-T_0/\tau}}{1-e^{-T/\tau}}\approx\frac{T_0}{T},  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  V_0=\frac{e^{-T_1/\tau}-e^{-T/\tau}}{1-e^{-T/\tau}}\approx\frac{T-T_1}{T}=\frac{T_0}{T} 
  \]
  which is the average value of the impulse train.
\end{itemize}
In particular, when $T_0=T_1=T/2$, we have
\[ 1-e^{-T/\tau}=(1+e^{-T_0/\tau})(1-e^{-T_0/\tau}) \]
and
\[ V_1=\frac{1-e^{-T_0/\tau}}{1-e^{-T/\tau}}=\frac{1}{1+e^{-T_0/\tau}},\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
V_0=\frac{e^{-T_1/\tau}-e^{-T/\tau}}{1-e^{-T/\tau}}=\frac{e^{-T_0/\tau}}{1+e^{-T_0/\tau}},
\;\;\;\;\;\;V_0+V_1=1 \]

\htmladdimg{../figures/ImpulsetrainResponse1a.gif}

$T_0=T_1=T/2=1$, $\tau=0.5$.


{\bf Example 2} 

Consider the steady state response of an undamped second order system with
parameters $\zeta=0$ and $\omega_n$ to a symmetric square impulse train of
period $2T_0$:
\[
x(t+2T_0)=x(t)=\left\{ \begin{array}{cl}1&0<t<T_0\\0&T_0<t<2T\end{array}\right.
\]
where $T_0$ is both the on and off-time of the impulse train, which can also
be written as:
\[ x(t)=u(t)-u(t-T_0)+u(t-2T_0)-u(t-3T_0)+u(t-4T_0)- \cdots \]
The response of the 2nd order system can be obtained based on its step
response $y(t)=1-\cos(\omega_nt)$:
\begin{itemize}
\item \[ y(t)=1-\cos\omega_nt,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(0<t<T_0) \]
\item \[ y(t)=(1-\cos\omega_nt)-(1-\cos\omega_n(t-T_0))
  =-\cos\omega_nt+\cos\omega_n(t-T_0),\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(T_0<t<2T_0) \]
\item \begin{eqnarray}
  y(t)&=&(1-\cos\omega_nt)-(1-\cos\omega_n(t-T_0))+(1-\cos\omega_n(t-2T_0))
  \nonumber \\
  &=&1-\cos\omega_n(t-2T_0)+\cos\omega_n(t-T_0)-\cos\omega_nt,
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(2T_0<t<3T_0)
  \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
\item \begin{eqnarray} 
  y(t)&=&(1-\cos\omega_nt)-(1-\cos\omega_n(t-T_0))+(1-\cos\omega_n(t-2T_0))
  -(1-\cos\omega_nt(t-3T_0))
  \nonumber \\
  &=&-\cos\omega_nt+\cos\omega_n(t-T_0)-\cos\omega_n(t-2T_0)+\cos\omega_n(t-3T_0),
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(3T_0<t<4T_0)
  \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
\end{itemize}
We now consider two special cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $T_0=T=2\pi/\omega_n$ is the same as the natural period of
  the 2nd order system, then $\cos\omega_n(t-kT_0)=\cos\omega_nt$ and we have
  the following for all integer $k$:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \[ y(t)=1-\cos\omega_nt,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;2kT_0<t<(2k+1)T_0 \]
  \item \[ y(t)=0,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(2k-1)T_0<t<2kT_0 \]
  \end{itemize}
  \htmladdimg{../figures/ImpulsetrainResponse2a.gif}
\item If $T_0=T/2=\pi/\omega_n$, the period $2T_0$ of the impulse train is 
  the same as the natural period $T=2\pi/\omega_n$ of the 2nd system, 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \[ y(t)=1-\cos\omega_nt,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(0<t<T_0) \]
  \item \[ y(t)=\cos\omega_n(t-T/2)-\cos\omega_nt=-2\cos\omega_nt,
    \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(T_0<t<2T_0) \]
  \item \[ y(t)=1-\cos\omega_n(t-T)+\cos\omega_n(t-T/2)-\cos\omega_nt
    =1-3\cos\omega_nt,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(2T_0<t<3T_0) \]
  \item \[ y(t)=\cos\omega_n(t-T/2)-\cos\omega_nt+\cos\omega_n(t-3T/2)-\cos\omega_n(t-T)=-4\cos\omega_nt,\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;(3T_0<t<4T_0)
  \end{itemize}
  This is a sinusoid growing linearly.

\subsection*{Frequency Response Functions and Filtering}

A linear time-invariant (LTI) system with input $x(t)$ and output $y(t)$ 
can be described in frequency domain by their Fourier coefficients 
(Fourier transforms) $X(\omega)$ and $Y(\omega)$, which are complex 
variables representing the magnitude and phase of each frequency component 
$\omega$ contained in the signal. In particular, when the signals contain 
only a single frequency component $\omega$, as assumed in the discussion 
for AC circuit analysis, the Fourier coefficients $X(\omega)$ and $Y(\omega)$ 
of the input and output are essentially the same as their phasor representations
$\dot{X}$ and $\dot{Y}$ (with the variable of frequency $e^{j\omega}$ dropped).

The ratio of the output $Y(\omega)$ and the input $X(\omega)$ both represented
in frequency domain (phasor form) is called the {\em frequency response function 
(FRF)}. 

\[
H(\omega)=\frac{Y(\omega)}{X(\omega)}=\frac{\dot{Y}}{\dot{X}}
\]

\subsubsection*{First-order system as a filter}

The first order RC and RL systems can be considered as a high-pass and 
low-pass filter, if the voltage $v_R(t)$ across $R$ is treated as the 
output, while the voltage $v_0(t)$ across both components is treated as
the input.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf RC circuit} 

  Treating the RC circuit as a voltage divider, the phasor representations of
  the voltage across $R$ and $C$ are
  \[
  \dot{V}_R=\dot{V}_0\frac{R}{R+1/j\omega C}=\dot{V}_0\frac{j\omega RC}{j\omega RC+1}
  =\dot{V}_0\frac{j\omega\tau}{j\omega\tau+1}
  \]
  and
  \[
  \dot{V}_C=\dot{V}_0\frac{1/j\omega_c}{R+1/j\omega C}
  =\dot{V}_0\frac{1}{1+j\omega RC}=\dot{V}_0\frac{1}{1+j\omega\tau}
  \]
  where $\tau=RC$ is the time constant of this RC first order system. The 
  FRFs and transfer functions of the systems are
  \[ 
  H_R(\omega)=\frac{\dot{V}_R}{\dot{V}_0}=\frac{j\omega\tau}{j\omega\tau+1}
  \]
  \[ 
  H_C(\omega)=\frac{\dot{V}_C}{\dot{V}_0}=\frac{1}{1+j\omega\tau}
  \]
  $H_R$ and $H_C$ are high-pass and low-pass filters, respectively. At the 
  cut-off frequency defined as $\omega_c=1/\tau=1/RC$, the magnitude of the 
  output attenuates to $1/\sqrt{2}$ of the peak magnitude, the output power 
  is half of the input power:
  \[
  |H_R(\omega)|=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}0&\omega=0\\
  1/\sqrt{2}&\omega=\omega_c=1/\tau\\1&\omega=\infty\end{array}\right.
  \;\;\;\;\;\;\;
  |H_C(\omega)|=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}1&\omega=0\\
  1/\sqrt{2}&\omega=\omega_c=1/\tau\\0&\omega=\infty\end{array}\right.
  \]

\item {\bf RL circuit}

  Treating the RL circuit as a voltage divider, the phasor representation of
  the voltage across $R$ can be found to be
  \[
  \dot{V}_R=\dot{V}_0\frac{R}{R+j\omega L}
  =\dot{V}_0\frac{1}{1+j\omega L/R}=\dot{V}_0\frac{1}{1+j\omega\tau}
  \]
  \[
  \dot{V}_L=\dot{V}_0\frac{j\omega L}{R+j\omega L}
  =\dot{V}_0\frac{j\omega}{R/L+j\omega}=\dot{V}_0\frac{j\omega}{j\omega+1/\tau}
  =\dot{V}_0\frac{j\omega\tau}{j\omega\tau+1}
  \]
  where $\tau=L/R$ is the time constant of this RL first order system. The 
  FRFs and transfer functions of the system are
  \[ 
  H_R(\omega)=\frac{\dot{V}_R}{\dot{V}_0}=\frac{1}{j\omega\tau+1}
  \]
  \[
  H_L(\omega)=\frac{\dot{V}_L}{\dot{V}_0}=\frac{j\omega\tau}{j\omega\tau+1}
  \]
  and
  \[
  |H_R(\omega)|=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}0&\omega=\infty\\
  1/\sqrt{2}&\omega=\omega_c=1/\tau\\1&\omega=0\end{array}\right.
  \]
  This system is a low-pass filter as it passes low frequencies but 
  attenuates high frequencies. At the cut-off or corner frequency 
  $\omega_c=1/\tau=L/R$, the magnitude of the output attenuates to 
  $|H(\omega_c)|=1/\sqrt{2}$ of the peak magnitude, the output power 
  is half of the input power. In the Bode plots, the log-magnitude of 
  the FRF is defined as $ 20 \log_{10}|H(\omega)|$. At the cut-off 
  frequency, we have
  \[
  20 \log_{10}(1/\sqrt{2})=-20\log_{10}\sqrt{2}=-10\log_{10}2=-3
  \]
  (For more discussion of the Bode plots, see
  \htmladdnormallink{here}{http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e59/lectures/e59/node40.html}.)

  \htmladdimg{../figures/E84FirstOrderFilter.png}

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Second-order system as a filter}

In a second order system composed of the series combination of R, C, and L,
connected to an input voltage source $v_0(t)$, we can treat any of the voltages
$v_R(t)$, $v_C(t)$, and $v_L(t)$, across R, C, and L, respectively as the output. 

With all voltages represented in phasor form as $\dot{V}_0$, $\dot{V}_R$,
$\dot{V}_C$, and $\dot{V}_L$, we can find the voltage across R as the output
as (voltage divider):
\[
\dot{V}_R=\dot{V}_0\;\frac{Z_R}{Z_R+Z_C+Z_L}
=\dot{V}_0\;\frac{R}{R+1/j\omega C+j\omega L}
\]
and the FRF of the system is
\[
H_R(\omega)=\frac{\dot{V}_R}{\dot{V}_0}=\frac{R}{R+j(\omega L-1/\omega C)}
=\left[1+j\left(\frac{\omega L}{R}-\frac{1}{\omega CR}\right)\right]^{-1}
\]
As 
\[ Q=\frac{\omega_nL}{R}=\frac{1}{\omega_nRC}
\]
we have 
\[
\frac{L}{R}=\frac{Q}{\omega_n},\;\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{and}
\;\;\;\;\;\;\frac{1}{RC}=Q\omega_n 
\]
Substituting these into the equation above we get
\[ 
H_R(\omega)=\left[1+jQ\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_n}-\frac{\omega_n}{\omega}\right)\right]^{-1} 
\]
At the natural frequency $\omega=\omega_n$, the imaginary part is zero 
and $H_R=1$ reaches the maximum. In general, the {\em resonant frequency} 
$\omega_r$ of a system is defined as the frequency at which the magnitude
of its FRF is maximized. For this specific system the resonant frequency 
is the same as the natural frequency $\omega_r=\omega_n=1/\sqrt{LC}$. 

When $\omega$ is either lower or higher than $\omega_n$,
$|H_R(\omega)|<|H_R(\omega_n)|$. In general, the {\em bandwidth} of a 
band-pass filter defined as 
\[ 
\triangle \omega=\omega_2-\omega_1 
\]
where $\omega_1<\omega_n$ and $\omega_2>\omega_n$ are the two cut-off 
frequencies at which
\[ 
|H(\omega_1)|=|H(\omega_2)|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}=0.707,\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{or}
\;\;\;\;\;\;|H(\omega_1)|^2=|H(\omega_2)|^2=\frac{1}{2}
\]
In other words, the power of the output is halved when compared to 
that of the input. The cut-off frequency is therefore also called the 
{\em half-power frequency}. 

Specifically to find the cut-off frequencies and bandwidth of the second 
order system above, we note that if the imaginary part of the denominator 
is $\pm 1$:
\[
Q\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_n}-\frac{\omega_n}{\omega}\right)=\pm 1 
\]
then 
\[	
|H_R(\omega)|=\bigg|\frac{1}{1\pm j}\bigg|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\]
Therefore the cut-off frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ can be found
as the roots of the quadratic equations above, i.e., they should satisfy 
\[ 
Q\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_n}-\frac{\omega_n}{\omega}\right)=\pm 1,
\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;
\omega^2\pm\frac{\omega_n}{Q}\omega-\omega_n^2
=\omega^2\pm 2\zeta\omega_n\omega-\omega_n^2=0 
\]
In general a quadratic equation has two solutions. But here one of them 
is negative (with no physical meaning) and therefore ignored. The positive
solutions of these two quadratic equations are:
\[
\omega_{1,2}=\omega_n\left[\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{1}{2Q}\right)^2}\mp \frac{1}{2Q}\right]
=\omega_n\left(\sqrt{1+\zeta^2}\mp \zeta\right) 
\]
The bandwidth of a second order system can therefore be found to be:
\[
\triangle \omega=\omega_2-\omega_1=\frac{\omega_n}{Q}=2\zeta \omega_n
=2\frac{R}{2}\sqrt{\frac{C}{L}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}=\frac{R}{L}
\]
which is proportional to $\zeta$ and inversely proportional to $Q$. 



The bandwidth $\triangle\omega=2\zeta\omega_n=R/L$ happens to be the 
coefficient of the first order term in the canonical form of a second 
order system, which can now be written as:
\[ 
\ddot{y}(t)+2\zeta\omega_n\,\dot{y}(t)+\omega_n^2\, y(t)
=\ddot{y}(t)+\triangle\omega\,\dot{y}(t)+\omega_n^2\, y(t)= x(t) 
\]
The middle point between $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ is 
\[
\frac{\omega_1+\omega_2}{2}=\omega_n \sqrt{1+\zeta^2}\;>\;\omega_r=\omega_n
\] 
which is greater than the resonant frequency $\omega_n=\omega_r$,
and we have $\omega_2-\omega_n>\omega_n-\omega_1$.

\htmladdimg{../figures/bandwidth1.gif}

\htmladdimg{../figures/bandwidth.gif}

If $Q=1/2\zeta$ is much greater than 1 (typically $Q>10$, i.e., $\zeta<0.05$),
we have $\sqrt{1+\zeta^2} =\sqrt{1+(1/2Q)^2} \approx 1$, $\omega_0\approx\omega_n$,
and
\[
\omega_1\approx \omega_n-\frac{\triangle\omega}{2}
=\omega_n-\frac{2\zeta\omega_n}{2}=\omega_n(1-\zeta)
\]
\[
\omega_2\approx \omega_n+\frac{\triangle\omega}{2}
=\omega_n+\frac{2\zeta\omega_n}{2}=\omega_n(1+\zeta) 
\]

The frequency at which the magnitude of the frequency response function
of a system is maximized is the
\htmladdnormallink{\em resonant frequency}{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance}
of the system. Here we consider three different systems all based on 
the RLC circuit, when the voltage across each of the $R$, $C$, and $L$
components in the RCL series circuit is treated as the output, and the
corresponding resonant frequency.
\begin{itemize}
\item
  \[ 
  H_L(\omega)=\frac{V_L(\omega)}{V(\omega)}
  =\frac{j\omega L}{R+j\omega L+1/j\omega C}
  =\frac{(j\omega)^2}{(j\omega)^2+j\omega 2\zeta \omega_n+\omega_n^2}
  =\frac{(j\omega)^2}{(j\omega)^2+\triangle \omega j\omega +\omega_n^2}
  %\;\;\;\;\;\;H(s)=\frac{s^2}{s^2+\triangle\omega s +\omega_n^2}
  \]
  To find the resonant frequency at which $|H_L(\omega)|$ is maximized, 
  we let
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \frac{d}{d\omega}|H_L(\omega)|^2
    &=&\frac{d}{d\omega}\left[\frac{\omega^4}{(\omega_n^2-\omega^2)^2
        +4\zeta^2\omega^2\omega_n^2}\right]
    \nonumber\\
    &=&\frac{4\omega^3[(\omega_n^2-\omega^2)^2+4\zeta^2\omega^2\omega_n^2]
      -\omega^4[4\omega(\omega^2-\omega^2_n)+8\zeta^2\omega\omega_n^2]}{[(\omega_n^2-\omega^2)^2+4\zeta^2\omega^2\omega_n^2]^2}  =0
    \nonumber
  \end{eqnarray}
  i.e., the numerator is zero, or
  \[
  4\omega^3[(\omega_n^2-\omega^2)^2+4\zeta^2\omega^2\omega_n^2]
  =4\omega^5[\omega^2-\omega^2_n+2\zeta^2\omega_n^2]
  \]
  Solving this for $\omega$, we get the reasonant frequency of this system:
  \[
  \omega_r=\frac{\omega_n}{\sqrt{1-2\zeta^2}}>\omega_n
  \]
  We see that $|H_L(\omega)|$ will have a maximum if 
  $\zeta<1/\sqrt{2}=0.707$. However, if $\zeta>1/\sqrt{2}$, no real solution
  exists, i.e., there doesn't exist a frequency at which $H_L(\omega)$ peaks.
\item
  \[ 
  H_R(\omega)=\frac{V_R(\omega)}{V(\omega)}
  =\frac{R}{R+j\omega L+1/j\omega C}
  =\frac{j\omega 2\zeta \omega_n}{(j\omega)^2
    +j\omega 2\zeta \omega_n+\omega_n^2}	
  =\frac{j\omega \triangle \omega}
  {(j\omega)^2+\triangle \omega j\omega+\omega_n^2}
  %\;\;\;\;\;\;H(s)=\frac{\triangle\omega s}{s^2+\triangle\omega s +\omega_n^2}
  \]
  As discussed before, $|H_R(\omega)|$ is maximized, when $\omega=\omega_n$, 
  which is the reasonant frequency of this system.
\item
  \[
  H_C(\omega)=\frac{V_C(\omega)}{V(\omega)}
  =\frac{1/j\omega C}{R+j\omega L+1/j\omega C}
  =\frac{\omega_n^2}{(j\omega)^2+j\omega 2\zeta \omega_n+\omega_n^2} 
  =\frac{\omega_n^2}{(j\omega)^2+\triangle \omega j\omega+\omega_n^2}
  %\;\;\;\;\;\;H(s)=\frac{\omega_n^2}{s^2+\triangle\omega s +\omega_n^2}
  \]
  As the numerator of $H(\omega)$ is a constant (not a function of
  frequency $\omega$), we can find the frequency that minimizes the
  magnitude of the denominator: 
  \begin{eqnarray}
    \frac{d}{d\omega}\left[(j\omega)^2+j\omega 2\zeta\omega_n+\omega^2\right]^2
    &=&\frac{d}{d\omega} [(\omega_n^2-\omega^2)^2+4\zeta^2\omega_n^2\omega^2]
    \nonumber\\
    &=&-4\omega(\omega_n^2-\omega^2)+8\zeta^2\omega_n^2\omega=0
    \nonumber
  \end{eqnarray}
  Solving for $\omega$ we get the reasonant frequency of this system:
  \[
  \omega_r=\omega_n\sqrt{1-2\zeta^2}<\omega_n
  \]
  We see that $|H_C(\omega)|$ will have a maximum if 
  $\zeta<1/\sqrt{2}=0.707$. However, if $\zeta>1/\sqrt{2}$, no real 
  solution exists, i.e., there doesn't exist a frequency at which 
  $H_C(\omega)$ peaks.

At the natural frequency, the impedance of a series RCL circuit reaches
minimum, consequently the current reaches maximum and so does the voltage 
across the resistor. However, the voltage across the inductor reaches 
maximum at a frequency slightly higher than the natural frequency, and 
the voltage across the capacitor reaches maximum at a frequency slightly 
lower than the resonant frequency, as shown in the linear and log-scale 
plots below. (For Bode plots, see
\htmladdnormallink{here}{http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e59/lectures/e59/node40.html}.)

\htmladdimg{../figures/rcl_plots2.gif}
\htmladdimg{../figures/rcl_plots1.gif}

For a parallel RCL circuit with current input, due to the duality between 
current and voltage, parallel and series configuration, the same derivation
of bandwidth can be carried out to obtain the same conclusions. 

While the phenominon of resonance can be destructive in mechanical systems
(for example, the famouse story of the
\htmladdnormallink{Angers bridge}{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angers_Bridge}),
and it therefore needs to be avoided, it can also be very useful in electrical
system such as in the tuning circuit in radio or TV broadcasting.


\begin{comment}

{\bf Summary:}
\begin{itemize}

\item The resonant frequency of both series and parallel RCL circuits is
  completely determined by $L$ and $C$: $\omega_n=1/\sqrt{LC}$, independent 
  of the resistance $R$ in the circuit.

\item At the resonant frequency $\omega=\omega_n$, the impedance $Z=1/Y$ of
  a series RCL circuit is real and minimized (admittance maximized), and the 
  current through the three components reaches maximum; the admittance $Y=1/Z$ 
  of a parallel RCL circuit is real and minimized (impedance maximized), and 
  the voltage across the three components reaches maximum. 

\item In series RCL with voltage input and parallel RCL with current input, 
  the quality factor $Q$ is proportional to the ratio between $L$ and $C$:
  \[ 
  Q_s=\frac{1}{R}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}},\;\;\;\;Q_p=R\sqrt{\frac{C}{L}}=\frac{1}{Q_s} 
  \]

\item In series RCL, $Q_s$ is inversely proportional to $R$ (the larger $R$, 
  the smaller $Q_s$, and the wider bandwidth), while in parallel RCL, $Q_p$ 
  is proportional to $R$ (the larger $R$, the larger $Q_p$,
  and the narrower bandwidth).
\end{itemize}

\end{comment}


{\bf Example:} 

\htmladdimg{../figures/LC_R.png}
%\htmladdimg{../figures/bandblock.gif}

The impedance of the parallel combination of $L$ and $C$ is:
\[ 
Z_{LC}=Z_C||Z_L=\frac{Z_LZ_C}{Z_L+Z_C}
=\frac{j\omega L/j\omega C}{j\omega L+1/j\omega C}
=\frac{j\omega L}{1-\omega^2 LC}
=\frac{j\omega L}{1-(\omega/\omega_n)^2 } 
\]
At the resonant frequency $\omega=\omega_n=1/\sqrt{LC}$, $Z_{LC}=\infty$
(open-circuit):
\[
|Z_{LC}|=|Z_C||Z_L|\stackrel{\omega=\omega_n}{\Longrightarrow}\infty
\]
The FRF of the two circuits are:
\[
H_{LC}=\frac{Z_{LC}}{Z_{LC}+R},\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;
H_{LC}=\frac{R}{Z_{LC}+R}
\]
\begin{itemize}
\item In the first circuit, when $\omega=\omega_n$, the voltage 
  drop across $R$ is zero (no current), the output voltage is the 
  same as the input voltage. Otherwise either $\omega>\omega_n$ or
  $\omega<\omega_n$, $Z_{LC}$ is finite, the voltage drop across $R$ 
  is non-zero, the output voltage is reduced. This is a band-pass
  filter:
  \[ 
  V_{out}=V_{LC}=V_0\frac{Z_C||Z_L}{R+Z_C||Z_L}
  =\left\{\begin{array}{cc}0&\omega\rightarrow 0\\
  V_0&\omega=\omega_n\\
  0&\omega\rightarrow\infty\end{array}\right.
  \]

\item In the second circuit, when $\omega=\omega_n$, $Z_{LC}=\infty$, 
  i.e., the LC parallel branch is an open-circuit, the output voltage 
  is zero. Otherwise either $\omega>\omega_n$ or $\omega<\omega_n$, 
  $Z_{LC}$ is finite, the voltage is non-zero. The circuit is a 
  band-stop or band-block filter:
  \[ 
  V_{out}=V_R=V_0\frac{R}{R+Z_C||Z_L}
  =\left\{\begin{array}{cc}V_0&\omega\rightarrow 0\\
  0&\omega=\omega_n\\
  V_0&\omega\rightarrow\infty\end{array}\right.
  \]

\end{itemize}


\subsubsection*{Amplitide, Phase, and Frequency Modulations}

In radio or TV broadcast, the audio or video signal $s(t)$ to be transmitted 
is used to modulate the amplitude, phase, or frequency of the carrier signal 
$c(t)=\cos(\omega_c t)$ with {\em carrier frequency} $\omega_c=2\pi f_C$, which
is much higher than the highest frequency component of the signal $s(t)$. The 
modulated signal $x(t)$ is then transmitted.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em Amplitude Modulation (AM)}

  The amplitude of the carrier is modulated by the signal $s(t)$ and becomes 
  time variant:
  \[ 
  x(t)=\cos(\omega_c t)\,[1+k_a s(t)]
  \]  
  where $0<k_a<1$ is the amplitude modulation index, and we assume the 
  amplitude of the signal is no greater than 1. For example, if the signal
  is sinusoidal $s(t)=\cos(\omega_s t)$, then the modulated signal is:
  \[ 
  x(t)=\cos(\omega_ct)[1+\cos(\omega_st)]
  =\cos(\omega_ct)+\frac{1}{2}[\cos(\omega_c+\omega_s)t+\cos(\omega_c-\omega_s)t] 
  \]
  In order to transmit all signal frequencies up to the highest frequency
  component $\omega_{max}$ in the signal, a bandwidth of 
  $\triangle\omega=(\omega_c+\omega_{max})-(\omega_c-\omega_{max})=2\omega_{max}$ 
  centered around the carrier (or central) frequency $\omega_c$ is required.  

\item {\em Phase Modulation (PM)}
  
  The phase of the carrier is modulated by the signal $s(t)$ and becomes
  time variant:
  \[
  x(t)=\cos(\omega_ct+k_p s(t))
  \]
  where $k_p$ is the phase modulation index. For example, if the signal is 
  sinusoidal $s(t)=\cos(\omega_s t)$, then the modulated signal is:
  \[ 
  x(t)=\cos(\omega_ct+k_p \cos(\omega_st))
  \]
  where $k_p$ is the phase modulation index. The phase angle of the carrier 
  is modulated to vary within the range of $(-k_p,\;k_p)$.

\item {\em Frequency Modulation (FM)}  
  
  The frequency of the carrier is modulated by the signal $s(t)$ and becomes
  time variant:
  \[
  \omega(t)=\omega_c+k_f s(t)
  \]
  where $k_f$ is the frequency modulation index. As $\omega(t) =d\phi(t)/dt$,
  the angle is also time variant:
  \[
  \phi(t)=\int_0^t\omega(\tau)d\tau=\int_0^t ( \omega_c+k_f s(\tau)) d\tau
  =\omega_c t+k_f \int_0^t s(\tau)d\tau
  \]
  and the modulated signal is:
  \[ 
  x(t)=\cos(\phi(t))=\cos\left(\omega_c t+k_f \int_0^t s(\tau)d\tau\right)
  \]
  For example, if the signal is sinusoidal $s(t)=\cos(\omega_s t)$, then
  the modulated signal is:
  \[ 
  x(t)=\cos\left(\omega_c t+k_f \int_0^t \cos(\omega_s \tau)d\tau\right)
  =\cos\left(\omega_c t+\frac{k_f}{\omega_s} \sin(\omega_s t)\right)
  \]

  \htmladdimg{../figures/AMFMmodulation.png}

\end{itemize}

The amplitude-modulated signal can be demodulated to recovered the signal
$s(t)$ from the transmitted signal by RF amplification, rectification, 
low-pass filtering, and audio signal amplification.

\htmladdimg{../figures/AMdemodulation.png}
  


In any of the three case above, it requires a certain bandwidth around the
carrier frequency $\omega_c$ to transmit the modulated signal. Consequently, 
the $Q$ value of the tuner of the receiver needs to be very carefully chosen.
It needs to be high enough for good selectivity between different radio 
stations, but, on the other hand, it cannot be too high in order to have a 
bandwidth wide enough to contain all frequency components in the signal.

{\bf Radio/TV Broadcasting and Frequency Allocation}

\begin{itemize}
\item The AM radio frequency range is from 535 kHz to 1605 kHz with 10 kHz
  frequency spacing or bandwidth, i.e., the highest signal frequency allowed 
  is about 5 kHz (while the upper limit of the audible frequencies is 20 kHz). 
\item The FM radio frequency range (VHF) is from 88 MHz to 108 MHz with 
  0.2 MHz=200 kHz frequency spacing, corresponding to a much wider
  bandwidth that makes high fidelity and stereo broadcasting possible. 
\item The TV broadcasting is also in MHz frequency range with a much wider 
  spacing of 6 MHz, needed to carry video as well as audio signals. 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item VHF: 54 MHz to 210 MHz (not continuous, for channels 2 to 13) 
  \item UHF: 470 MHz to 884 MHz (not continuous, for channels 14 to 83)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has very specific frequency allocation 
regulations, see the \htmladdnormallink{FCC frequency allocation chart}{http://www.ntia.doc.gov/osmhome/allochrt.pdf}.




{\bf Example 1:}

A series RCL circuit composed of an inductor $L=80\mu H$ and $R=8\Omega$
and a capacitor $C$ is connected to a voltage source. Find the value of 
$C$ for this circuit to resonate at $f=400\;kHz$, also find the bandwidth.

{\bf Solutioin:}
\[
\omega_n=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}},\;\;\;\;
C=\frac{1}{\omega_n^2 L}=\frac{1}{(2\pi 400\times 10^3)^2\times 80\times 10^{-6}}
=20nF	\]
The quality factor is
\[
Q=\frac{\omega_n L}{R}=\frac{2\pi 400\times 10^3\times 80\times 10^{-6}}{8}=25.13
\]
The bandwidth is
\[ 
\triangle f=\frac{f_0}{Q}=\frac{400\times 10^3}{25.13}=15.9\;kHz 
\]
or 
\[ 
\triangle \omega= 2\pi\triangle f=\frac{\omega_n}{Q}=\frac{R}{L}=10^5 
\]

{\bf Example 2:} 

Resonant circuit is widely used in radio and TV receivers to select a 
desired station from many stations available. The circuit are shown in 
the figure below. Assume $L=0.3\; mH,\;\;R=16\;\Omega$, and $C$ is a 
variable capacitor, which can be adjusted to match the resonant frequency 
of the circuit to the frequency of the desired station. Assume the 
frequency of the desired station is 640 kHz, find the value of $C$ and 
the bandwidth of the tuning circuit. Moreover, if the induced voltage in 
the circuit is $e=2\;\mu V$ (rms), find the current (rms) in the resonant
circuit, and the output voltage (rms) across the capacitor.

\htmladdimg{../figures/tuning.gif}

{\bf Solution:} At the desired resonant frequency $f=640\;kHz$, the 
reactance of the inductor is
\[
X_L=\omega L=2\pi f L
=2\times 3.14\times 640\times 10^3\times 0.3\times 10^{-3}=1206\;\Omega 
\]
and the quality factor $Q$ of this circuit is 
\[
Q=\frac{\omega L}{R}=\frac{X_L}{R}=\frac{1206}{16}\approx 75
\]
The bandwidth is:
\[
\triangle f =\frac{f_0}{Q}=\frac{640}{75}\approx 8.53\;kHz 
\]
The resonant frequency can be expressed as:
\[
f_0=\frac{\omega_0}{2\pi}=\frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}=640\;kHz	
\]
Solving this we get
\[
C=\frac{1}{(2\pi f_0)^2L}=206\times 10^{-12}F=206\;pF	
\]
The current in circuit is
\[
I_{rms}=e/R=2\times 10^{-6}/16=0.125\times 10^{-6}\; A =0.125\;\mu A
\]
The voltage across $R$ is
\[
V_R=I_{rms} R=0.125\times 16\times 10^{-6}=2\times 10^{-6}\;V=0.002\;mV
\]
The output voltage across $C$ is
\[
V_C = V_L=I_{rms} X_L=0.125\times 10^{-6}\times 1206=151\times 10^{-6}\;V
=151\;\mu V =0.151\;mV=Q\,V_R
\]
which is $Q=75$ times the voltage $V_R=2\times 10^{-6}$ across $R$ 
(same as the voltage source).


{\bf Example} 

In reality, all inductors have a non-zero resistance, therefore a 
parallel resonance circuit should be modeled as shown in the figure.

\htmladdimg{../figures/parallelRCL.gif}

The admittance is:
\begin{eqnarray}
  Y(\omega)&=&\frac{1}{R+j\omega L}+j\omega C
  =\frac{R-j\omega L+j\omega C(R^2+\omega^2L^2)}{R^2+\omega^2L^2}
  \nonumber \\
  &=&\frac{1}{R^2+\omega^2L^2}[R-j(\omega L-\omega C(R^2+\omega^2L^2))]
  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
As frequency $\omega$ appears in the real part $Re[Y(\omega)]$ as well 
as in the imaginary part $Im[Y(\omega)]$, the frequency that minimizes 
$|Y(\omega)|$ has to be found by solving
\[
\frac{d}{d\omega} \; |Y(\omega)| =0 	
\]
However, when the quality factor $Q=\omega_n L/R$ associated with the
non-ideal inductor is large enough (e.g., $Q > 20$), all previous discussed 
relations for ideal inductors still hold approximately, and the resonant 
frequency $\omega_n$ can still be found approximately by the previous 
approach by letting $Im[Y(\omega)]=0$: 
\[	\omega_n L=\omega_n C(R^2+\omega_n^2L^2),\;\;\;\;\Longrightarrow
	\;\;\;\;\;\omega_n=\sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}-\left(\frac{R}{L}\right)^2}	\]
For $\omega_n$ to be real, we must have
\[	\frac{1}{LC} > (\frac{R}{L})^2, \;\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{i,e,}
	\;\;\;\;\;\;R<\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}	\]
Typically we have $R \ll \sqrt{L/C}$, and the resonant frequency is
\[
\omega_n=\sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}-\left(\frac{R}{L}\right)^2}\approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}
\]

{\bf Note: } For the same reason, when considering the transfer function
of a series RCL circuit when the output is the voltage across either $C$
or $L$, the peak frequency $\omega_p$ is not exactly the same as the 
resonant frequency $\omega_n$, which only minimizes the denominator, but
the numerator is still a function of $\omega$. Only when the output is 
the voltage across $R$ (i.e., the numerator is $R$, a constant, not a 
function of $\omega$), will the resonant frequency $\omega_n$ be the same 
as the peak frequency.

\subsection*{Real and Reactive Power and Power Factor}

\htmladdimg{../figures/powerfactor.gif}

All loads of a power plant can be modeled by a two-terminal network of
passive elements (resistors, inductors, capacitors, without any energy 
sources) with complex impedance 
\[
Z=R+jX=|Z|e^{j\angle Z}=|Z|\angle Z 
\]
where $	|Z|=\sqrt{R^2+X^2},\;\;\;\angle Z=\tan^{-1}(X/R)=\phi$.

As the loads are typically inductive (e.g., electric motors, transformers), 
i.e., $X=j\omega L$, the phase angle $\phi$ of the impedance is positive. 
We are concerned with the energy consumption and storage in the load. We 
know if $X=0$, energy delivered by the source is completely consumed by 
the resistive load $R$; on the other hand, if $R=0$, all energy is stored 
in and released from the inductive load $L$ in each cycle. In the following
we consider the case in which neither $R$ nor $L$ is zero.

Let the input voltage to the load network be:
\[
v(t)=\sqrt{2}V_{rms} \cos(\omega t),\;\;\;\;\dot{V}=V_{rms}\angle 0 
\]
then the current through the power transmission line and load can be found:
\[
\dot{I}=\frac{\dot{V}}{Z}=\frac{V_{rms}}{|Z|\angle \phi}=
I_{rms}\angle(-\phi),\;\;\;\;i(t)=\sqrt{2}I_{rms} \cos(\omega t-\phi)  
\]
where $I_{rms}=V_{rms}/|Z|$ is the RMS or effective value of the current.
Note that the current is lagging the voltage by an angle $\phi$.

Consider the {\em instantaneous power} of the load defined as the product
of the voltage and current:
\begin{eqnarray}
  p_{in}(t) &=&
  v(t)\;i(t)=\sqrt{2}V_{rms}\cos(\omega t)\;\sqrt{2}I_{rms}\cos(\omega t-\phi)
  \nonumber \\
  &=&2V_{rms}I_{rms}\;\cos(\omega t)\;[\cos(\omega t)\cos\phi
    +\sin(\omega t)\sin\phi ]	\nonumber \\
  &=&V_{rms}I_{rms} \left[\cos\phi\, \left(2\cos^2(\omega t)\right)
  +\sin\phi\,\left(2\cos(\omega t)\sin(\omega t)\right) \right] \nonumber \\
  &=&V_{rms}I_{rms} \;\left[ \cos\phi\; p(t) + \sin\phi\; q(t) \right] \nonumber \\
  &=& S \;\left[\cos\phi\; p(t) + \sin\phi\; q(t) \right] 	\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
Here we have used $\cos(u-v)=\cos u\;\cos v+\sin u\;\sin v$, and we
have defined the {\em apparent Power (in volt-amperes)} 
\[ 
S=V_{rms}I_{rms} 
\]
and
\[ 
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} 
  p(t)=2\cos^2(\omega t)=1+\cos 2\omega t\\
  q(t)=2\cos(\omega t)\sin(\omega t)=\sin 2\omega t
\end{array} \right. 
\]
Note that
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{1}{T}\int_T p(t)dt&=&\frac{1}{T}\int_T [1+cos(2\omega t)] dt=1	
  \nonumber \\
  \frac{1}{T}\int_T q(t)dt&=&\frac{1}{T}\int_T \sin(2\omega t) dt=0	
  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
As shown in the plots below, the instantaneous power $p_{in}(t)$ can be both 
positive (energy consumed by the load) and negative (energy released by the
load), and it can be represented as either a product of $v(t)$ and $i(t)$, 
or a sum of weighted $p(t)$ and $q(t)$. Note that $p_{in}(t)$ 

\htmladdimg{../figures/instantaneouspower0.gif}
%\htmladdimg{../figures/instantaneouspower1.gif}

Consider the {\em average power} over one period $T=2\pi/\omega$:
\begin{eqnarray}
  P_{average}&=&\frac{1}{T}\int_T p_{in}(t)dt
  =\frac{1}{T}\int_T  S \;\left[\cos\phi\; p(t) + \sin\phi\; q(t) \right] dt
  \nonumber \\
  &=&S\cos\phi\;\frac{1}{T}\int_T p(t)dt+S\sin\phi\;\frac{1}{T}\int_T q(t)dt
  \nonumber \\
  &=&S\cos\phi\;1 + S\sin\phi\; 0
  \nonumber \\
  &=&P\;1+Q\;0=P 
  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Here we have defined
\begin{itemize}
\item $P=S\cos\phi$ as the {\em real power} (in Watts), which represents 
  the average power dissipation by the load over one period $T$:
\item $Q=S\sin\phi$ as the {\em reactive power} (in volt-ampere reactive or VARs),
  which is not consumed but converted back and forth between the energy source
  and the energy storing elements (inductors and capacitors)
\end{itemize}
Note that if $R=0$, the load is purely inductive $Z=R+jX=j\omega L$ with
$\phi=\pi/2$, $P=S\cos\phi=0$ and $Q=S\sin\phi=S$, i.e., the power is one 
hundred percent reactive, with no real power consumed.

These definitions of real and reactive power suggest that the apparent power 
$S=V_{rms}I_{rms}$ can be consided to be the magnitude of a complex product of 
$\dot{V}=V_{rms}\angle 0$ and 
$\dot{I}^*=(I_{rms}\angle(-\phi))^*=I_{rms}\angle\phi$
\[
\dot{V}\dot{I}^*=V_{rms}\angle 0\; I_{rms}\angle \phi=V_{rms}I_{rms}\angle \phi
=S(\cos\phi+j\;\sin\phi)=P+jQ	
\]
But as $\dot{V}=\dot{I}Z=\dot{I}(R+jX)$, the above can also be written as:
\[
\dot{V}\dot{I}^*=\dot{I}\dot{Z}\dot{I}^*=\dot{I}\dot{I}^*(R+jX)=I^2_{rms}R+j I^2_{rms}X	
\]
\htmladdimg{../figures/ComplexPower.png}

Comparing the two expressions of $\dot{V}\dot{I}^*$ above, we get:
\[ 
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}P=I^2_{rms}R=S\;\cos\phi \\
Q=I^2_{rms}X=S\;\sin\phi \end{array} \right. 
\]
We see that the real power $P=I^2_{rms}R$ is dissipated by the resistive
component $R$ of the load, while the reactive power $Q=I^2_{rms}X$ is stored 
in and released from the reactive component $L$ of the load. 

%The power consumed by an electrical motor is not reflected by the RL 
%circuit shown above. A more complete model of an electrical motor can be
%found \htmladdnormallink{here}{../MotorModel/MotorModel.html}.

{\bf Improvement of Power Factor}

The {\em Power factor} is defined as
\[
\lambda\stackrel{\triangle}{=}\cos \phi < 1
\]
which represents the phase difference between the voltage and current in 
the system, and the ratio between the real power $P=S \cos\phi$ and the 
reactive power $Q=S \sin\phi$. To increase the efficiency of the power
transmission system, i.e., to deliver the real power $P$ to the load with
minimum reactive power $Q$ (thereby minimum current and power dissipation 
along the transmission line), it is desirable to maximize the power factor 
$\lambda$ by reducing $\phi$. Specifically, we can include a 
\htmladdnormallink{\em shunt capacitor}{https://www.google.com/search?q=shunt+capacitor&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS505US508&espv=2&biw=921&bih=969&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=3RlRVMK1DJCCoQTvtYKIBg&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg&dpr=1.5}
$C$ to cancel the inductive effect in the system, thereby reducing $\phi$ 
and increasing $\lambda$. There are two possible ways to do this.

\begin{itemize}
\item The most straight forward way is to add the shunt capacitor in 
  series with the inductive load, so that the inductive reactance $jX_L$
  is completely canceled by the capacitive reactance $-jX_C$, i.e., the 
  load becomes a resonant RCL (series) circuit::

  \htmladdimg{../figures/ShuntCapacitor0.png}

  \[
  jX_L-jX_C=j\omega L+\frac{1}{j\omega C}=0 
  \]

  Solving this equation we get the desired capacitance $C_s=1/\omega^2L$. 
  As now the overall load is a series RCL circuit at resonance with quality 
  factor $Q$, the magnitude of the voltage across the inductor and the 
  capacitor is $Q$ times the source voltage:
  \[
  \dot{V}_L=jQ\dot{V},\;\;\;\;\;\dot{V}_C=-jQ\dot{V}	
  \]
  At resonance, the voltage across $R$ is the same as the source 
  $\dot{V}_R=\dot{V}$, while the voltages across $L$ and $C$ are 
  $\dot{V}_L=jQ\dot{V}$ and $\dot{V}_C=-jQ\dot{V}$, respectively. 
  The voltage across the inductive load $R+j\omega L$ becomes 
  $\dot{V}_{RL}=\dot{V}_L+\dot{V}_R=jQ\dot{V}+\dot{V}=(1+jQ)\dot{V}$, 
  which could be much higher than the expected source voltage $\dot{V}$ 
  (without capacitor $C$) if $Q$ is large. Consequently, improper 
  operation of the load or even damage may result.

\item Alternatively, to avoid the drawback above, the shunt capacitor $C$ 
  can be added in parallel to the inductive load so that it still gets the 
  expected voltage.

  \htmladdimg{../figures/ShuntCapacitor1.png}

  Now the overall load becomes 
  \[
  Z'=Z_{RL}||Z_C=(R+j\omega L)\; || \;(1/j\omega C)
  =\frac{(R+j\omega L)/j\omega C}{(R+j\omega L)+1/j\omega C}
  =\frac{R+j\omega L}{j\omega CR-\omega^2 LC+1}	
  \]
  For the new phase angle $\phi=\angle Z'$ to be zero, the phases of the
  numerator and denominator need to be the same, i.e.,
  \[
  \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\omega L}{R}\right)
  =\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\omega RC}{1-\omega^2 LC}\right),
  \;\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;\;\;
  \frac{\omega L}{R}=\frac{\omega RC}{1-\omega^2 LC}	
  \]
  Solving this equation for $C$ we get the desired capacitance:
  \[
  C_p=\frac{L}{R^2+\omega^2 L^2} =\frac{1}{R^2/L+\omega^2 L}<\frac{1}{\omega^2L}
  =C_s
  \]
%  or equivalently
%  \[ X_C=X_L+\frac{R^2}{X_L} \]
  Now the voltage across the inductive load is still the same as the voltage
  source as expected, and another benefit is that the required capacitance $C_p$
  is smaller than the capacitance $C_s=1/\omega^2 L$ required for the series 
  approach.

To reduce the cost of a large capacitance needed for the phase angle of 
the load to be reduced to zero $\phi=0$ so that $\lambda=\cos\phi=1$, it 
is acceptable for the improved power factor to be less than 1, e.g., 0.9. 
In this case, the phase angle of the load is
\[
\phi=\angle Z'=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\omega L}{R}\right)-\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\omega RC}{1-\omega^2 LC}\right)=\cos^{-1}\; 0.9=25.8^\circ 	
\]
Solving this equation for $C$ we get the required capacitance. As now we have
\[
\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\omega L}{R}\right)>\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\omega RC}{1-\omega^2 LC}\right) 
\]
i.e.,
\[
\frac{\omega L}{R}>\frac{\omega RC}{1-\omega^2 LC}	
\]
we get an even smaller capacitance which is more practically implementable:
\[
C<\frac{L}{R^2+\omega^2 L^2}=\frac{1}{R^2/L+\omega^2L} 
\]



\subsection*{Load/Source Matching for Maximum Power}

{\bf Maximize power delivery in AC systems}

Previously we considered the maximization of the power received by a
resistive load $R_L$. This problem can be generalized to AC circuit containing
$C$ and $L$, as well as $R$. Consider a voltage source composed of an ideal 
voltage source $\dot{V}_0=V_{rms}\angle 0^\circ$ in series with an internal 
impedance $Z_0=R_0+jX_0$, and a load impedance $Z_L=R_L+jX_L$. The load current
is:
\[
\dot{I}=\frac{\dot{V}_0}{Z_0+Z_L}=\frac{\dot{V}_0}{(R_0+R_L)+j(X_0+X_L)}  
\]
And we have:
\[  |\dot{I}|^2=I^2_{rms}=\frac{|\dot{V}_0|^2}{|Z_0+Z_L|^2}
  =\frac{V^2_{rms}}{(R_0+R_L)^2+(X_0+X_L)^2} \]
The real power consumed by the load is:
\[
P_L=I_{rms}^2 R_L =\frac{V^2_{rms}R_L}{(R_0+R_L)^2+(X_0+X_L)^2}
=\frac{V^2_{rms}R_L}{|Z_0+Z_L|^2}
\]
The denominator is the squared magnitude of a complex variable
$Z_0+Z_L=(R_0+R_L)+j(X_0+X_L)$, which is minimized if the imaginary part 
$X_0+X_L$ is zero, i.e., $X_0=-X_L$ (while the real part $R_0+R_L>0$ is 
always positive). Now $P_L$ becomes:
\[
P_L=I_{rms}^2 R_L=\frac{V^2_{rms}R_L}{(R_0+R_L)^2} 
\]
This is the power delivered to the load resistance $R_L$, which is maximized
if it matches the internal resistance of the source $R_L=R_0$, as discussed 
before. Combining these two requirements $X_L=-X_0$ and $R_L=R_0$, we conclude
that if $Z_L=R_L+jX_l=R_0-jX_0=Z_0^*$, i.e., the load impedance $Z_L$ is the 
complex conjugate of the internal impedance $Z_0$, the load receives maximum
power:
\[
P_L=\frac{V^2_{rms}R_L}{(R_0+R_L)^2}=\frac{V_{rms}^2}{4R_0} 
\]

{\bf Example:}
Find load impedance $Z_L$ so that it receives maximum power from the rest 
of the circuit. Find this maximum power $P_L$ and load current $\dot{I}_L$.

\htmladdimg{../figures/ch3Ex1.gif}

Assume voltage source $V_0=200 V$, current source $I_0=j\;10 A$, and the 
impedances of $R$, $L$, and $C$ are respectively $10\;\Omega$, 
$j\;10\;\Omega$, and $-j\;10\;\Omega$. To solve this circuit, we can use 
either Thevenin's voltage source or Norton's current source method.

\begin{itemize}
\item Find $Z_N=Z_T$: turn off both voltage and current sources, find 
  $Z_{RL}=Z_L+Z_R=10+j10$ and the interanl (Thevenin or Norton) impedance:
  \[ 
  Z_N=Z_T=Z_{RL}||Z_C=\frac{Z_{RC}Z_C}{Z_{RC}+Z_C}
  =\frac{-j10(10+j10)}{10+j10-j10}=10(1-j)=R_0+jX_0
  \]
  where $R_0=10\;\Omega$, $X_0=-10\;\Omega$.
\item Find open-circuit voltage $\dot{V}_T=\dot{V}_{oc}$ across load port 
  by superposition principle. Due to voltage source alone:
  \[
  \dot{V}'_{oc}=V_0\frac{Z_C}{Z_{RL}+Z_C}
  =200\frac{-j10}{(10+j10)-j10}=-200j 
  \]
  Due to current source alone:
  \[ 
  \dot{V}''_{oc}=I_0\;Z_{RL}||Z_C
  =j10\frac{(10+j10)(-j10)}{(10+j10)-j10}=100+100j 
  \]
  Now we have
  \[
  \dot{V}_T=\dot{V}_{oc}=\dot{V}'_{oc}+\dot{V}''_{oc}=-200j+100+100j=100(1-j)
  =100\sqrt{2}\angle(-45^\circ) 
  \]
\item Find short-circuit current $\dot{I}_N=\dot{I}_{sc}$ through load port
  by superposition principle:
  \[ 
  \dot{I}_N=I_0+\frac{V_0}{Z_{RL}}
  =10j+\frac{200}{10+10j}=10j+\frac{20(1-j)}{(1+j)(1-j)}=10 
  \]
\end{itemize}
The relationship between the Norton current and Thevenin voltage can be
verified:
\[
\dot{I}_N Z_N=10\times10(1-j)=100(1-j)=100\sqrt{2}\angle(-45^\circ)=\dot{V}_T  
\]
For the load to receive maximum power, it needs to be
\[
Z_L=Z_T^*=Z_N^*=R_0-jX_0=10(1+j) 
\]
The maximum power delivered to load is:
\[
P_L=\frac{V^2_{rms}}{4R_0}=\frac{(100\sqrt{2})^2}{4\times 10}=500\;W 
\]
The current through the load is:
\[ 
\dot{I}=\frac{\dot{V}}{2R_0}=\frac{100\sqrt{2}\angle(-45^\circ)}{20}
=5\sqrt{2}\angle (-45^\circ) 
\]

{\bf Geometric mean method}

The load resistance $R_L$ will receive maximum power only if it matches the 
internal resistance $R_0$ of the voltage source, $R_L=R_0$. However, when
$R_L\ne R_0$, the resistance match can still be achieved by inserting a 
matching circuit between the source and load as shown in the figure. 

The matching circuit is composed of two capacitors $C_1=C_2$ of the same 
impedance $-jX$ and an inductor $L$ of impedance $jX$. Alternatively, the 
two capacitors and the inductor in the matching circuit can be replaced by 
two inductors and a capacitor. If the frequency of the voltage source is 
$\omega=2\pi f$, then $X=\omega L=1/\omega C$, i.e., $LC=1/\omega^2$.

\htmladdimg{../figures/matchingcircuits.gif}

The total impedance of the new load composed of all four components $C_1=C_2$,
$L$ as well as $R_L$ is real (resistive):
\[ 
Z_L=-jX+jX || (R_L-jX)=-jX+\frac{jX(R_L-jX)}{R_L}=\frac{X^2}{R_L} 
\]
Or, in the alternative case, the impedance of the new load is the same:
\[
Z_L=jX+(-jX) || (R_L+jX)=jX+\frac{-jX(R_L+jX)}{R_L}=\frac{X^2}{R_L} 
\]
For this load impedance $Z_L$ to match the internal resistance $R_0$ of the 
source, we have
\[
Z_L=\frac{X^2}{R_L}=R_0,\;\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;X=\sqrt{R_0R_L} 
\]
i.e., the reactance $X$ is the geometric mean of the source and load resistances
$R_0$ and $R_L$. Note that the matching circuit consumes no real power as it 
does not have any resistance. We can verify that the power consumed by $R_L$ is 
$P_L=V^2/4R_0$.

This method can be generalized to any AC circuit composed of a voltage 
source with an internal impedance $Z_0=R_0+jX_0$ and load impedance 
$Z_L=R_L+jX_L$ in the following two steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item First we replace the impedance $-jX$ of capacitor $C_2$ in series 
  with the load by $-j(X+X_L)$, so that the additional reactance $-X_L$ 
  cancels the load reactance $X_L$, and the impedance in the load branch
  is $R_L-jX$.
\item Next we replace the impedance $-jX$ of capacitor $C_1$ in series 
  with the source by $-j(X+X_0)$, so that the additional reactance $-jX_0$
  cancels the source reactance $X_0$, and the impedance in the source
  branch is $R_0-jX$.
\item We can show that the impedance of the equivalent load composed 
  of $-j(X+X_0)$, $jX$, and $-j(X+X_L)$ of the matching circuit and 
  $Z_L=R_L+jX_L$ of the load is indeed the complex conjugate of the
  internal impedance $Z_L=R_0+jX_0$ of the source:
  \[ 
  Z_L=-j(X+X_0)+jX || (R_L-jX)=-j(X+X_0)+\frac{jX(R_L-jX)}{R_L}
  =\frac{X^2}{R_L}-jX_0=R_0-jX_0 =Z^*_0 
  \]
  i.e., now the load-source resistance match is achieved. 
\end{itemize}

As this method requires a fixed reactance $X$, it is valid for single
frequency $\omega=1/\sqrt{LC}$.

{\bf Example:} An audio amplification circuit with an output voltage $V_0$
and internal resistance $R_0=200\;\Omega$ is used to drive a speaker with 
$R_L=8\;\Omega$. 
The power received by the speaker is:
\[ P_L=I^2R_L=\frac{V_0^2}{(R_0+R_L)^2}R_L=V_0^2\frac{8}{208^2} \]
The power consumed by the internal resistance $R_0$ is:
\[ P_0=I^2R_0=\frac{V_0^2}{(R_0+R_L)^2}R_0=V_0^2\frac{200}{208^2} \]
The total power delivered is:
\[ P_T=P_L+P_0=\frac{V_0^2}{R_0 || R_L} =V_0^2\frac{208}{208^2} \]
The speaker gets only $P_L/P_T=8/208=3.8\%$ of the total power, while the 
remaining $P_0/P_T=200/208=96.2\%$ of the power is consumed internally. 

To maximize the power delivered to the speaker, we add a matching circuit 
composed of $C_1=C_2$ with impedance $Z_C=-jX$ and $L$ with impedance 
$X_L=jX$. When $X=\sqrt{R_0R_L}=\sqrt{1600}=40$, the resistance of the new
load $R'_L=200\;\Omega$ matches the internal resistance $R_0$ of the source,
and the speaker receives maximum power of $P_L=V_0^2/4R_0=V^2/800$ (half of
the total power $P_T=V^2/2R_0=V^2/400$), 6.76 times the power without
the matching circuit. 

As the frequency in the system is not constant, the matching is achieved
only at one particular frequency, typically chosen to be the middle of
the frequency range. 

{\bf Matching resistances by a transformer}

An ideal transformer can be used to match the load $R_L$ to the internal 
resistance $R_0$ of the source. Recall the following relations for an ideal 
transformer
\[
P_1=V_1I_1=P_2=V_2I_2,\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;
\frac{I_2}{I_1}=\frac{V_1}{V_2}=\frac{n_1}{n_2}=r	
\]
where $r=n_1/n_2$ is the turn ratio. As $V_2=V_1/r$ and $I_2=rI_1$, we have 
\[ 
R_L=\frac{V_2}{I_2}=\frac{V_1/r}{rI_1}=\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{V_1}{I_1}
=\frac{R'_L}{r^2}
\]
where we have defined $R'_L=V_1/I_1$, which is related to the real load by
$R'_L=r^2 R_L$. For the load to receive maximum power $P_L=P'_L$, we need to 
match the equivalent load resistance $R'_L$ to match $R_0$:
\[ 
R_0=R'_L=r^2 R_L,\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;\;
r=\frac{n_1}{n_2}=\sqrt{\frac{R_0}{R_L}} 
\]
%Note that this method does not work for load of complex impedance.

\htmladdimg{../figures/transformerexample.gif}

{\bf Example:} In the previous example with $R_0=200\;\Omega$, 
$R_L=8\;\Omega$, a transformer with turn ratio of 
$r=\sqrt{R_0/R_L}=\sqrt{200/8}=5$ can be used to match the load
$R_L=8$ to internal resistance $R_0=200$.



{\bf Example:} $R_0=1000\Omega$, $R_L=10\Omega$, and the voltage 
source is $V=12V$. Find the turn ratio of the transformer so that 
the load resistor will get maximum power from the voltage source.

When the load resistor receives maximum power if its resistance 
is equal to the internal resistance of the voltage source. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Convert load resistance on the secondary side $R_L=10\Omega$ to 
	$R'_L=r^2\; R_L=10\; r^2$ on the primary side.
\item Match $R'_L=10\;r^2$ to $R_0$, i.e., $10\; r^2=1000\Omega$
\item Find turn ratio $r=n_1/n_2=10$.
\item Find power consumption on $R'_L$: 
	\[ P=\frac{V}{4R'_L}=36/1000=0.036W	\]
\item The power consumed by real load $R_L$ is the same, due to ideal 
transformer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Review of Complex Arithmetic} 

A complex number can be represented in two different formats in either
the Euclidean and polar coordinate system:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Euclidean representation:} 

  $z=x+jy$ where $x$ and $y$ are the real (horizontal) and imaginary 
  (vertical) part of complex variable $z$, respectively.
\item {\bf Polar representation:} 

  $z = |z|\;e^{j\angle z}$, or simply $z=|z|\;\angle z$, where $|z|$ and
  $\angle z$ are the magnitude and phase angle, respectively.
\end{itemize}

\htmladdimg{../figures/complex_number.gif}

The two representations can be converted from one to the other:
\begin{itemize}
\item From $(x,y)$ to $(|z|,\angle z)$:
  \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} |z|=\sqrt{x^2+y^2} & \mbox{magnitude}\\
    \angle z=tan^{-1} (y/x) & \mbox{phase angle}
  \end{array} \right. 
  \]
\item From $(|z|,\angle z)$ to $(x,y)$:
  \[ 
  z=|z|\;e^{j\angle z}=|z|(\cos\angle z+j\;\sin\angle z)=x+jy 
  \]
  due to Euler identity, i.e.,
  \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} x=|z|\;\cos\angle z & \mbox{real part}\\
    y=|z|\;\sin\angle z & \mbox{imaginary part}
  \end{array} \right. 
  \]
\end{itemize}

The arithmetic operations of two complex numbers $z=x+jy=|z|\;e^{j\angle z}$ 
and $w=u+jv=|w|\;e^{j\psi}$ are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Add/Subtract:} 
  \[	z+w=(x+u)+j(y+v),\;\;\;\;z-w=(x-u)+j(y-v)	\]

\item {\bf Multiply:}
  \[ z\;w=(x+jy)(u+jv)=(xu-yv)+j(xv+yu)=|z|\;|w|\;e^{j(\angle z+\angle w)} \]

\item {\bf Divide:}
  \[	\frac{z}{w}=\frac{x+jy}{u+jv}=\frac{(x+jy)(u-jv)}{(u+jv)(u-jv)}
	=\frac{(xu+yv)+j(yu-xv)}{u^2+v^2}
	=\frac{|z|}{|w|}\;e^{j(\angle z-\angle w)}	\]

\item {\bf Rotation:}

  When a complex number, a vector in complex plane, $z=|z|\;e^{j\angle z}$ is
  multiplied by $e^{j\alpha}$, it becomes $z\;e^{j\angle z}=|z|\;e^{j(\angle z+\alpha)}$, 
  i.e., rotated by an angle of $\alpha$. The rotation is counter-clock wise
  if $\alpha>0$, but clock-wise if $\alpha<0$. When the rotating angle is a 
  linear function of time $\alpha=\omega t$, then vector
  $z=|z|\;e^{j(\angle z+\omega t)}$ becomes a rotating vector with angular frequency
  $\omega$.

  In particular, As $e^{j\pi/2}=j$ and $e^{-j\pi/2}=-j$, they can be considered 
  as $90^\circ$ rotation factors. Any complex number multiplied by $j$ or $-j$ 
  will be rotated counter clockwise or clockwise by 90 degrees.

\item {\bf Complex Conjugate:}

  The complex conjugate of $z=x+jy=|z|e^{j\angle z}$ is 
  $z^*=x-jy=|z|e^{-j\angle z} $. In general, $z^*$ can be obtained by
  negating every $j$ in the expression of $z$ (replacing $j$ by $-j$). 
  The magnitude of a complex number $z=x+jy$ can be found by:
  \[	
  \sqrt{zz^*}=\sqrt{(x+jy)(x-jy)}=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=|z|
  \]

\item {\bf Reciprocal:}
  \[	|z^{-1}|=\frac{1}{|z|}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},\;\;\;\;
	\angle\left(z^{-1}\right)=\angle\left(\frac{1}{z}\right)
        =0-\angle{z}=-\angle z	\]

\end{itemize}

{\bf Addition/Subtraction of Sinusoids:}

Consider the addition/subtraction of two sinusoids of the same frequency 
$\omega$:
\[ \left\{ \begin{array}{l} x_1(t)=A_1\cos(\omega t+\phi_1)\\
  x_2(t)=A_2\cos(\omega t+\phi_2) \end{array} \right. \]
As the frequency of the sum is obviously the same as $\omega$, we can write
the sum as:
\[ x(t)=x_1(t)+x_2(t)=A\cos(\omega t+\phi) \]
and we need to find $A$ and $\phi$ in terms of $A_1$, $A_2$, $\phi_1$ and 
$\phi_2$.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x(t)&=&x_1(t)+x_2(t)=A_1\cos(\omega t+\phi_1)+A_2\cos(\omega t+\phi_2)
  \nonumber \\
  &=&A_1\cos\omega t\cos\phi_1-A_1\sin\omega t\sin\phi_1
  +A_2\cos\omega t\cos\phi_2-A_2\sin\omega t\sin\phi_2
  \nonumber \\
  &=&(A_1\cos\phi_1+A_2\cos\phi_2)\cos\omega t
  -(A_1\sin\phi_1+A_2\sin\phi_2)\sin\omega t
  \nonumber \\
  &=&A\cos\phi\cos\omega t-A\sin\phi\sin\omega t
  \nonumber \\
  &=&A_r\cos\omega t-A_j\sin\omega t
  \nonumber \\
  &=&A \cos(\omega t+\phi) 
  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where we have used the trigonometric identity 
$\cos(\alpha+\beta)=\cos\alpha\cos\beta-\sin\alpha\sin\beta$
and assumed
\[ 
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} A_r=A\cos\phi =A_1 \cos\phi_1+A_2 \cos\phi_2\\
  A_j=A\sin\phi =A_1\sin\phi_1+A_2\sin\phi_2\end{array} \right. 
\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{and}\;\;\;\;\;
\left\{ \begin{array}{l} A=\sqrt{A^2_r+A^2_j}\\
  \phi=\tan^{-1} (A_j/A_r) \end{array} \right. 
\]
Here $(A_r\,A_j)$ and $(A,\,\phi)$ are respectively the Cartesian and polar 
representations of the same vector in the complex plane $A_r+j\;A_j=A e^{j\phi}$.
