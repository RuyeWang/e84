{\bf Modeling of Electrical Motor}

A motor is modeled by a resistance R, an inductance L and a back or counter 
EMF (electromotive force) voltage $v_b$. The counter EMF is directly related to 
the velocity and angular velocity, which in turn is related to the mechanical 
work done by the motor.

When the motor runs without a load (assuming zero friction), $v_b=0$ and it 
can be simply modeled by R and L in series. The only power consumed is $i^2R$, 
for the internal heat up of the motor due to R. When the load is not zero, the 
$v_b$ is not zero and the power consumed by the motor is $i v_b$.
