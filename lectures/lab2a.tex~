{\Large \bf E84 Lab 2: Construction of a Radio Receiver}

{\bf Final construction due 5 pm, last day of class, paper submission due one week earlier}

Pick up the hardware of the radio receiver kit from the stock room,
including all the components and the construction manual.

\section{Part 1: Transistor Circuits}

\subsection{Transistor Testing}

Different types of transistors are used in the 
\htmladdnormallink{AM/FM radio receiver kit}{../amfm108TK.pdf}
of this lab, including five
\htmladdnormallink{2N3904}{http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/2N/2N3904.pdf}
transistors (also available in our stock room). Use the 
\htmladdnormallink{Type 575 semiconductor curve tracer}{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_curve_tracer}
in the electronic lab to test these transistors in common emitter mode. 
Specifically, observe both the input and output characteristic plots.

{\bf Important note:} To make sure not to burn your transistor, 
(a) study the datasheet of the transistor to determine the leads for E, B and C,
(b) do not apply $V_{CC}$ voltage higher than 30 V.

{\bf Recommended control knob initial settings:}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Display control} (top-right)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Vertical axis (for $I_B$ or $I_C$): 1 mA/Div
  \item Horizontal axis ($V_{BE}$ or ``base voltage''): 0.1 or 0.5 V/Div
  \item Horizontal axis ($V_{CE}$ or ``collector voltage''): 2 V/Div
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf Collector voltage} (lower-left)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Peak voltage range: x1 (be careful to use x10 as maximum voltage is 200 V)
  \item Polarity: + for npn transistors
  \item Peak Volt ($V_{CC}$): 10 to 20 Volts
  \item Dissipation limiting resistor ($R_C$): 1 k$\Omega$
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf Base voltage} (lower-right)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Repetitive/Single scan: repetitive
  \item Steps/family: 12
  \item Polarity: +
  \item Steps/Sec: 240
  \item Series resistor ($R_B$):
  \item Step selection: $0.005 mA = 5 \mu A$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Transistor Circuit Construction}

Design and build the following basic transistor voltage amplifier shown 
in the figure below. (Use $V_{CC}\le 20\;V$.) Test the circuit by a signal 
generator and an oscilloscope. ($R_S$ in the diagram is the output 
rersistance of the signal generator.) Display both input and output signals 
(sinusoidal) on the screen (use both channels). Observe the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item DC operating point (should be in the middle of the linear range)
\item Voltage amplification
\item Polarity inversion
\item The upper and lower peak clipping (by increasing the amplitude of 
  the input sinusoid).
\end{itemize}

{\bf Submission:}

\begin{itemize}
\item The sketch or photo of both the input and output characteristic plots 
  observed on the screen of the semiconductor curve tracer with the following
  labeling (with reasonable and meaningful increment):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The voltage (horizontal axis) $V_{BE}$ or $V_{CE}$
  \item The current (vertical axis) $I_B$ or $I_C$
  \item For the output plot, each one of the 12 $I_B$ values in the family
  \end{itemize}
\item Determine the value $\beta=I_C/I_B$ (also referred to as the 
  ``forward transfer current ratio'' and denoted by $h_f$ or $h_{FE}$ on
  the \htmladdnormallink{2N3904 datasheet}{http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/2N/2N3904.pdf}
  (see \htmladdnormallink{class notes}{http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e84/lectures/ch4/node7.html})
  from the output plot for each of the 5 transistors.
\item Determine $V_{BE}$ from the input plot when $I_B$ is within the range of
  0.01 to 0.1 mA, correspondingly $I_C$ is in the range of $0.01\;\beta$ to 
  $0.1\;\beta$.
\item Describe how the load line changes in the output plot when (a) $R_C$ 
  increases/decreases, and (b) $V_{CC}$ increases/decreases.
\item Determine the voltage gain of the transistor ampilfier. Submit the sketch
  or photo of the oscilloscpoe showing both input and output at the same time.
\end{itemize}
