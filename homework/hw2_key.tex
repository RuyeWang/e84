\htmladdimg{../hw2e.gif}

{\bf Solution:}
\begin{itemize}
\item before S is closed, $R=(3+2)//(6+2)=5//8=40/13 \Omega$
\item after S is closed, $R=2//2+3//6=1+2=3 \Omega$
\end{itemize}

\item Find the current I3 through the load resistor of 6$\Omega$ by the
following two methods:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Convert the two voltage sources to equivalent current sources, 
	simplify the circuit and solve for the current;
\item Use superposition theorem to consider one of the two sources at a
	time, then add the two partial results to get the final result.
\end{enumerate}

\htmladdimg{../hw2g.gif}

{\bf Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Conversion from voltage to current source:
\begin{itemize}
\item convert first voltage source (left):   $I1=10V/1\Omega=10A$, $R1=1$
\item convert second voltage source (right): $I2=6V/3\Omega=2A$, $R2=3$
\item combine two parallel current sources: $I0=I1+I2=12A$
\item combine two parallel resistors: $R0=(R1\times R2)/(R1+R2)=3/4=0.75$
\item use current divider to find current:
       $I=I0 R0/(R+R0)=12\times 0.75/(6+0.75)=4/3=1.33A$
\end{itemize}
\item Superposition theorem:
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider only the voltage source on the left. Parallel resistance
of $3\Omega$ and $6\Omega$ is $3\times 6/(3+6)=2\Omega$. Overall resistance
is $1+2=3\Omega$, overall current is $10/3A$, and
\[	I'_3=\frac{10}{3}\times \frac{3}{3+6}=\frac{10}{9} \]

\item Consider only the voltage source on the right.Parallel resistance
of $1\Omega$ and $6\Omega$ is $1\times 6/(1+6)=6/7\Omega$. Overall resistance
is $3+6/7\Omega$, overall current is $6/(3+6/7)=14/9A$, and
\[	I''_3=\frac{14}{9}\times \frac{1}{1+6}=\frac{2}{9} \]

\item Find the overall current:
\[	I_3=I'_3+I''_3=\frac{10}{9}+\frac{2}{9}=\frac{12}{9}=\frac{4}{3} \]
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\item Find the three currents labeled as I1, I2 and I3 in the same figure 
	above by the following method:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Apply KCL to node a to get a current equation;
\item Apply KVL to the two loops to get two voltage equations;
\item Solve the three equations for the unknown currents I1, I2 and I3.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Solution:}
\begin{itemize}
\item $I1+I2-I3=0$, $10V-I1=6V+3I2$, $10V-I1=6I3$
\item solve to get: $I1=2$, $I2=-2/3$, $I3=4/3$
\end{itemize}

\item Find all currents labeled $I_k (k=1,2,3,4,5)$ in the circuit below. 
The resistance of a resistor labeled by 10K, for example, is 10,000
Ohms ($10,000 \Omega=10K\Omega$).

{\bf Hint:} follow these steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Choose node 0 as the reference point or ``ground'', and let the 
	voltages at nodes 1 and 2 be $V_1$ and $V_2$ (with respect to
	node 0), respectively. 
\item Express all currents in terms of the node voltages $V_1$, $V_2$
	and other known quantaties such as the current and voltage sources
	and the resistors.
\item Apply KCL to node 1 and node 2 to get two current equations, 
	substitute all current expressions into the two equations.
\item Solve the two equations for $V_1$ and $V_2$.
\item Find all currents.
\end{itemize}

\htmladdimg{../hw2h.gif}

{\bf Solution:}
\begin{itemize}
\item KCL equations: $I1+I2+I3-I0=0$, $-I3+I4+I5=0$
\item $I1=V1/R1$, $I2=V1/R2$, $I3=(V1-V2)/R3$, $I4=V2/R4$, $I5=(V2+V0)/R5$
\item substitute I1 through I5 into KCL equations and solve for V1 and V2 
	to get: $V1=21.8V$, $V2=-21.8V$
\item obtain all currents: $I1=1.09$, $I2=0.545$, $I3=4.36$, $I4=-1.09$, $I5=5.46$
\end{itemize}

\item Find all currents I1 through I5 in the circuit below. 

{\bf Hint:} use the loop current method: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Assume the currents around the four loops are Ia, Ib, Ic and Id 
  with Ia=10A and Id=6.5A (due to the two current sources).
\item Apply KVL to the two middle loops to get two equations.
\item solve them for two unknown currents Ib and Ic, get I1 through I5.
\end{itemize}

\htmladdimg{../hw2i.gif}

{\bf Solution:}
\begin{itemize}
\item KVL: $(2+3+4)Ib-2Ia-4Ic=-10$, $(4+3+2)Ic-4Ib-2Id=10$
\item solve to get $Ib=2.8A$, $Ic=3.8A$, then find I1 thru I5:
	$I1=Ia-Ib=7.2A$, $I2=Ib-Ic=-1A$, $I3=Ic-Id=-2.7A$, $I4=Ib=2.8A$,
	$I5=Ic=3.8A$
\end{itemize}

\item Find the optimal load resistance $R_L$ so that it receives maximal
power from the current source $I_0=10A$ with internal resistance 
$R_0=1\Omega$ and power transmission line resistance $R_T=9\Omega$. 
Find the maximum load power and the power loss along the transmission 
line.

\htmladdimg{../hw2f.gif}

To verify your choice of load resistance, show that the power consumption
of the load will always be lower than this maximum when its resistance is 
either increased or decreased by ten percent.

{\bf Solution:}
First convert current source to voltage source with $V_0=I_0 R_0=10V$
and $R_0=1 \Omega$. To maximize load power consumption, let 
$R_L=R_0+R_T=10 \Omega$. The current is $I=10V/20\Omega=0.5A$. Load power 
is $I^2R_L=10/4=2.5W$, power loss on transmission line is $I^2R_T=9/4A$
When $R_L=11\Omega$, $I=10V/21\Omega$, $W_L=I^2 R_L=2.494$
When $R_L=9\Omega$, $I=10V/19\Omega$, $W_L=I^2 R_L=2.493$

\item Using Thevenin's theorem to determine the current in the $3-\Omega$ 
resistor of the following figure.

\htmladdimg{../hw2c.gif}

% move two voltage sources to left, and 3-$\Omega$ resistor to the right as load
% find equivalent voltage Vo and internal resistance and Ro:
% current going clockwise around the loop (without load): (30-24)/(6+12)=1/3
% voltages across 6 ohm resistor and 12 ohm resistor are -2V and 4V, Vo=30-2=24+4=28V
% Ro=6//12=4ohm, current through load resistor is 28/(4+3)=7A

\item Find voltage across and the current through the 10-$\Omega$ resistor.

\htmladdimg{../hw2d.gif}

% use superposition principle. When 24V is acting alone with 1A open, 
% parallel resistors 15 and 10 become 15//10=6, V'ab=24 x 6/(6+6)=12V
% I'=12/10=1.2A. When 1A is acting alone with 24V closed, parallel resistors
% 6 and 15 become 90/21, I''=10/(10+90/21)=3/10=0.3 A, V''ab=I'' x 10=3V
% overall V=V'+V''=12+3=15, I=I'+I''=1.2+0.3=1.5A


\item The circuit in the figure below has a voltage source $V_0=20V$ and a current 
source $I_0=3A$, and four resistors $R_1=20\Omega$, $R_2=10\Omega$, $R_3=30\Omega$ 
and $R_4=10\Omega$. Find the voltage across $R_4$ and the power dissipated by it.

\htmladdimg{../hw2a.gif}

%If voltage source acts alone (current source open), according to voltage divider,
%V'_4=V0 R4/(R2+R2) = 10V, power consumption is W'=V^2/R=10^2/10=10W
%If current source acts alone (voltage source short), according to current divider
%V''_4=(I0 R2/(R22+R4) R4=[3x10/(10+10)x10=15V, power consumption is W''=V^2/R=15^2/10=22.5W
%Total V_4=V'_4+V''_4=10+15=25V, total power W=25^2/10=62.5W not equal to 10+22.5=32.5

\item 

Find all currents in the diagram in which V=120V, $R_1=2\Omega$, $R_2=20\Omega$. 
{\bf Hint:} it is very hard to solve the problem by finding the currents in the
order of $I_1$, $I_3$, $I_5$, as computing the resistances of the resistor 
network is tedious. However, it is much more straight forward to find the 
currents in the order of $I_5$, $I_3$, $I_1$, if you assume $I_5$ is known, e.g.,
$I_5=1A$. However, the voltage for the voltage source obtained based on this 
assumption is of course not as given (120V). In this case, the linearity property
$F(ax+by)=aF(x)+bF(y)$ can be applied. In particular, given $y=F(x)$, then 
$ay=F(ax)=aF(x)$. Use this relationship to find the actual values of the 
currents.
