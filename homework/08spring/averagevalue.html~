\section{Average Value of Sinusoids}

The average voltage is defined as:
\[
V_{av}=\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T v(t) dt	
\]
If the current/voltage is periodic, i.e., it repeats itself every 
time cycle $T$, then $i(t)=i(t+T)$ and $v(t)=v(t+T)$. The reciprocal 
of $T$ is called the {\em fundamental frequency}. In particular, for 
a sinusoidal current 
\[
i(t)=I_p\,\sin(\omega t)=I_p\,\sin(2\pi ft)=I_P\,\sin(2\pi t/T)
\]
the average over the complete cycle $T=1/f$ is always zero (the charge
transferred during the first half is the opposite to that transferred
in the second). However, we can consider the half-cycle average over 
$T/2$:
\begin{eqnarray} 
  I_{av}&=&\frac{1}{T/2}\int_0^{T/2} i(t)\; dt
  =\frac{2}{T}\int_0^{T/2} \;I_P\,\sin(2\pi t/T)\;dt	
  =-\frac{2}{T}\frac{TI_P}{2\pi} \cos(2\pi t/T)\bigg|_0^{T/2}
  \nonumber \\
  &=& \frac{1}{\pi}\left[\cos(0)-\cos(\pi)\right]I_P
  =\frac{2}{\pi}I_P\;=0.637\,I_P
  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
