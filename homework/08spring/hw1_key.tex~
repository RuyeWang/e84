\item (a) If two light bulbs both labeled as 110V and 40W in series are
connected to a socket outlet of 190V, what is the power consumption of 
each of the bulbs?

{\bf Solution:}
\[ R=V^2/W=110^2/40,\;\;\;\;\; V'=190/2=95	\]
\[ W'=V'^2/R=W (V'/V)^2=40 (95/110)^2=40\times 0.746=29.83	\]

(b) Replace one of the two bulbs by another bulb labeled as 110V 15W, and
find the power consumption of each of the bulbs. What will happen to each
of the two bulbs? (Note that when the power consumption by a bulb is larger
than the specified wattage, it will be burned out!)

{\bf Solution:}
\[ V=110,\;\;V'=190,\;\;R1=V^2/W1=110^2/40,\;\;R2=V^2/W2=110^2/15	\]
\[ I=V'/R=V'/(R1+R2),\;\; W1'=I^2 R1=8.89,\;\;W2'=I^2 R2=23.67>15\;\;\;
	\mbox{burned out!}	\]

\item Measurement of a physical process by instruments may be tricky as
the instruments will inevitably affect the process being measured. The 
figure below shows two possible configurations for the measurement of the
voltage across and the current through the load. 

\htmladdimg{../hw1b.gif}

\begin{enumerate}
\item What are required of the ammeter and the voltmeter to minimize their
	influences on the measurements? 

{\bf Solution:}
The ammeter should have minimum (ideally 0) impedance while the voltmeter
should have maximum (ideally infinity) impedance. 

\item How would the ammeter and the voltmeter affect the measurement of the
	current and the voltage in either of the configurations (a and b)?
\end{enumerate}

{\bf Solution:}
In (a) the voltmeter will by-pass some current so that the actual current
through the load is smaller than the reading of the ammeter.

In (b) the ammeter will cause some voltage drop and the actual voltage 
across the load is lower than the reading of the voltmeter. 

\item Use Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws to find voltage $V_{BD}$ and resistance 
$R_2$ in the circuit shown below:

\htmladdimg{../hw1c.gif}

(Note: The direction of a current and the polarity of a voltage source can
be assumed arbitrarily. To determined the actual direction and polarity, the
sign of the values also should be considered. For example, a current labeled 
in left-to-right direction with a negative value is actually flowing 
right-to-left.)

{\bf Solution:}
\begin{itemize}
\item apply KCL to node B: $2+(-6)+I2=0$, $I2=-4$ 
\item apply KCL to node C: $-4+1-I3=0$, $I3=-3$
\item apply KCL to node D: $5-3+I4=0$, $I4=-2$
\item apply KVL to loop ABCD: 
	$10+2\times 1+(-4)\times R2+6+(-3)\times 1-(-2)\itimes 5=0$, 
	$R2=6.25$
\item apply KVL to loop BDA: $V_{BD}+2\times 5+10+2\times 1=0$, 
	$V_{BD}=-22V$, or
\item apply KVL to loop BDC: $V_{BD}-(-3)\times 1-6-(-4\times 6.25)=0$, 
	$V_{BD}=-22V$
\end{itemize}

%\item A current flowing in an initially uncharged 1-$\mu$F capacitor is shown
%  in the figure as a function of time. Find and plot the voltage across the 
%  capacitor produced by this current.

%\htmladdimg{../hw1a.gif}

%{\bf Solution:}

%\[ i(t)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 10-5t & 0<t<3 \\ 2.5t-12.5 & 3<t<5 
%\end{array} \right. \]
%Voltage across capacitor is:
%\[ v(t)=\frac{1}{C} \int i(t) dt = \frac{1}{C} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 
%  10t-2.5t^2 & 0<t<3 \\ 1.25t^2-12.5t+33.75 & 3<t<5 \end{array} \rignt. \]

\item Find the equivalent resistance between the two terminals before and
after the switch is closed. (Note, the two diagonal branches are NOT
connected to each other in the middle.)

\htmladdimg{../hw2e.gif}

{\bf Solution:}
 before S is closed, $R=(3+2)//(6+2)=5//8=40/13 \Omega$

 after S is closed, $R=2//2+3//6=1+2=3 \Omega$

\item Find the equivalent resistance $R_{eq}$ between the two terminals
in the figure, where $R_0=3\Omega$, $R_1=4\Omega$, $R_2=2\Omega$, $R_3=2\Omega$, 
$R_4=1\Omega$. What is $R_{eq}$ if $R_0=5\Omega$?

(Hint: apply a test voltage $V_{test}$ across the terminals and the 
equivalent resistance can be found to be $R_{eq}=V_{test}/I_{test}$.
The circuit can be solved by applying KCL to $V_1$ and $V_2$.)

\htmladdimg{../hw1f.gif}

{\bf Solution:}

\[ \frac{v_1-v_{test}}{4}+\frac{v_1-0}{2}+\frac{v_1-v_2}{3}=0 \]
\[ \frac{v_2-v_{test}}{2}+\frac{v_2-0}{1}+\frac{v_2-v_1}{3}=0 \]
solving these we get $v_1=v_2=v_{test}/3$. Then apply KCL to the
positive terminal to get
\[ i_{test}+\frac{v_1-v_{test}}{4}+\frac{v_2-v_{test}}{2}=0 \]
solving to get
\[R_{eq}=\frac{v_{test}}{i_{test}}=2 \Omega \]
Note that in this case $v_1=v_2$, independent of the value of $R_0$.

Alternatively, based on delta-Y conversion (to be considered later), the 
triangle (delta) formed by $R_0$, $R1$, and $R_2$ can be coonverted to a Y 
configuration with $R'_0=8/9$ (top), $R'_1=4/3$ (left), and $R'_2=2/3$. Then
we have $R'_1+R_3=10/3$ and $R'_2+R_4=5/3$. Their parallel combination is 
$10/3 || 5/3=10/9$, in series with $R'_0=8/9$, i.e., the total resistance
is $R_{eq}=10/9+8/9=2$. However, this approach does not reveal the fact that 
$R_0$ can take any value without changing $R_{eq}$.

\item Design a multimeter that can measure both DC and AC voltage, DC current,
  and resistance with different scales. Specifically, you are given an analog 
  meter $A$ with a needle display, which reaches full scale when a DC current 
  of $I=100\;\mu A=10^{-4}\;A$ goes through it. The internal resistance of the
  meter is 10 Ohms. In addition, you need some multi-position rotary switches 
  to select different scales for each of the three types of measurements, and 
  resistors with any values needed in your design.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item DC Voltage measurement: DC voltages in these ranges can be measured
      0-2.5, 0-10, 0-50, and 0-250 (all in volts). Use a 4-position rotary switch
      to select one of the four ranges as shown in the figure below. For example, 
      when the range of 0-10 is selected, the needle display will reach full scale 
      when the voltage being measured is 10 V. The circuit is shown below. Determine 
      all resistances labeled.

      \htmladdimg{../multimeterV.gif}

      {\bf Solution:} $R_1=25\;K\Omega$, $R_2=75\;K\Omega$, $R_3=400\;K\Omega$

      and $R_4=2\;M\Omega$.
    \item AC Voltage measurement: To measure an AC voltage (in terms of its
      RMS value), it first needs to be converted into a DC voltage. This can 
      be achieved by a diode which only allows the current to pass in one
      direction (along the arrow) but not the other. This process is called
      rectification. The diode will also cause a voltage drop of 0.7 volt 
      along the direction. The actual reading of the meter reflects the 
      average value of the rectified current. Find the resistance $R$ so 
      that when the incoming AC voltage is $V=10$ volt (RMS), the meter shows 
      a full scale display.

      \htmladdimg{../multimeterACV.gif}

      {\bf Solution:} The peak value of voltage is $10\times \sqrt{2}=14.14$,
      which is reduced (due to voltage drop of the diode) to $14.14-0.7=13.44$.
      The average value of the rectified voltage is $14.14/\pi=4.28$. For the
      meter to have a full scale display, the current need to be
      \[ 10^{-4}=\frac{4.28}{R},\;\;\;\;\;\;\mbox{i.e.}\;\;\;\;\;\;R=42.8\,k\Omega \]
      The internal resistance of $10\,\Omega$ can be neglected.

    \item DC current measurement: measure currents in these ranges (all in mA):
      0-0.5, 0-2.5, 0-10, 0-50. Use a 4-position rotary switch to select one 
      of the four ranges as shown in the figure below. For example, when the 
      range of 0-10 is selected, the needle display will reach full scale when 
      a 10 mA current is measured. Determine all resistances labeled. Use
      $R_0=1\;K\Omega$.

      \htmladdimg{../multimeterA1a.gif}

      {\bf Solution:} Voltage across input is $V=0.1\;mA\times 1\;K\Omega=100\;mV$.
      Therefore 
      \[ \begin{array}{l}
        R_1=100/(0.5-0.1)=250\;\Omega \\
        R_2=100/(2.5-0.1)=41.67\;\Omega \\
        R_1=100/(10-0.1)=10.1\;\Omega \\
        R_1=100/(50-0.1)=2\;\Omega
      \end{array}
      \]

    \item Resistance measurement: The circuit for resistance measurement is
      provided as shown below, where $V_1=1.5V$. Determine the values for the 
      resistors labeled as $R_0$, $R_1$, $R_{10}$, $R_{100}$ and $R_{1000}$ 
      and $V_2$ so that the needle display of the meter is full scale 
      ($I=100\;\mu A$) when the resistor $R=0$ being measured (between the 
      two leads labeled + and -) is zero, or half scale ($I=50\;\mu A$) when 
      the value of $R$ and the position of he two synchronized rotary switches
      are given in each of the four case shown in the table:

      \begin{tabular}{l|llll} \hline
	positions  & $\times 1$ & $\times 10$ & $\times 100$ & $\times 1K$ \\
	$R$ values & 20$\Omega$ & 200$\Omega$ & 2000$\Omega$ & 20 $K\Omega$ 
      \end{tabular}

      \htmladdimg{../multimeterR.gif}

      {\bf Solution:}

      \begin{itemize}
	\item First determine $R_0$: when $R=0$, we get 
	  $R_0=1.5V/0.1\;mA=15\;K\Omega$.
	\item When $R=20\;\Omega$, the current through meter $A$ should be:
	  \begin{eqnarray}
	    I&=&\frac{V_1}{R+R_1||R_0}\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_0}
	  =\frac{V_1}{R+\frac{R_1R_0}{R_1+R_0}}\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_0}
	  =V_1\frac{R_1}{RR_1+RR_0+R_1R_0} 	  \nonumber \\
	  &=&5\times 10^{-4}\;A 
	  \nonumber
	  \end{eqnarray}
	  Given $V_1=1.5V$, $R_0=15K$ and $R=20\Omega$, we can solve this 
	  equation to get 
	  \[ R_1=\frac{R_0RI}{V_1-I(R+R_0)}=20\Omega \]
	\item When $R=200\;\Omega$, solving the above equation we get 
	  $R_{10}=202.7\Omega$.
	\item When $R=2\;K\Omega$, solving the above equation we get 
	  $R_{10}=2307.7\Omega$.
	\item When $R=20\;K\Omega$, we need to determine $V_2$ and 
	  $R_{1k}$ so that $I=5\items 10^{-5} A$, and also when $R=0$, 
	  $I=10^{-4}A$. $R_{1k}$ and $V_1+V_2$ can be found by solving
	  these equations:
	  \[ \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
	    (V_1+V_2)/(R_{1k}+R_0)=10^{-4}A \\
	    (V_1+V_2)/(R+R_{1k}+R_0)=5\times 10^{-5}A
	  \end{array}\right. \]
	  Solving we get $V_1+V_2=2V$, $R_{1k}+R_0=20\;K\Omega$, i.e.,
	  $R_{1k}=5K\Omega$, $V_2=0.5V$
      \end{itemize}
