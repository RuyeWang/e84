\item The circuit shown in the figure contains a voltage source $V=10V$,
two resistors $R_1=300\Omega$ and $R_2=200\Omega$, and a silicon diode.
Find the voltage $V_D$ across and the current $I_D$ through the diode.
Solve this problem in two different methods: (a) assume voltage $V_D=0.7$ 
(as the diode is always forward biased), and (b) use the graphic approach
to find the intersection of the load line and the diode equation:
\[ I_D=I_0 ( e^{V_D/\eta V_T}-1 ) \]
Sketch the plot of the two curves and estimate the solution $(I_D,V_D)$
at their intersection. (Note that you can assume $I_0=10^{-10}$ and 
$V_T=0.026V$ at room temperature 300K.)

% {\bf Solution:} 
% Method 1: As the diode is forward biased, the voltage across it
% is 0.7V, and the current through $R_2$ is $0.7V/200\Omega=3.5mA$, and
% the current through $R_1$ is $(10-0.7)/300=31 mA$. The current through
% the diode is therefore $I_D=31-3.5=27.5 mA$.
% Method 2: set up the equation for $V_D$ and $I_D$:
% \[ \frac{V_D}{R_2}+I_D=\frac{V-V_D}{R_1} \]
% if $V_D=0$, $I_D=\frac{V}{R_1}=\frac{10}{300}=33.3 mA$
% if $I_D=0$, $V_D=V\;\frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}=10\frac{200}{300+200}=4V$
% the intersection of the two curves is aprroximately the same as method 1.

\item The circuit shown in the figure contains a voltage source $V=10V$,
three resistors $R_1=300\Omega$, $R_2=200\Omega$, and $R_3=100\Omega$, 
and two silicon diode. Find the voltage across the two parallel branches.
(Hint: assume $V_D=0.7$ when the diode is forward biased.)

% {\bf Solution:} As the diode is forward biased, the voltage across it
% is 0.7V. Assume the voltage in question is $x$, then we have the following
% equation:
% \[	\frac{10-x}{300}=\frac{x-0.7}{200}+\frac{x-0.7}{100}	\]
% which can be solved for $x$ to get the voltage to be $2.39V$.

\item The circuit shown in the figure is a converter (adaptor) based on
a full-wave rectifier, which gets an AC voltage input of 115V 60 Hz, and
produces a 12V DC output. The voltage variation or ripple of the output
should not exceed 5\% when the load current is no more than 2A. Design 
the converter in terms of the turn ratio of the transformer and the 
value of the capacitor.

\item The input voltage to the circuit in the following figure is
$v(t)=10 \sin (\omega t)$. The two DC voltages are both 5V. Sketch the
waveform of the output voltage $V_{out}$.

\item Assume each of the input voltages $V_1$ and $V_2$ takes one of
two values, either 0V or 5V. Find the output voltage $V_{out}$ in the
following combinations of three input:
 
\begin{tabular}{c||c c c c}\hline\hline
$V_1$ & 0V & 0V & 5V & 5V \\ \hline
$V_1$ & 0V & 5V & 0V & 5V \\ \hline
$V_{out}$ &   &   &   &   \\
\end{tabular}
