{\bf The Problems}
\begin{enumerate}


\item {\bf Problem 1. (33 points)} 

  In the circuit below, $R=5\Omega$, $V=5V$. $S_1$, $S_2$ and $S_3$
  are three switches. The current $I$ is measured in the following
  two cases:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Case 1: $S_1$ is closed but $S_2$ and $S_3$ are open, $I=2A$.
  \item Case 2: $S_2$ is closed but $S_1$ and $S_3$ are open, $I=3A$.
  \end{itemize}
  Find the value of $I$ in the following two cases:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Case 3 $S_1$ and $S_2$ are closed but $S_3$ is open.
  \item Case 4 $S_3$ is closed but $S_1$ and $S_2$ are open.
  \end{itemize}

  {\bf Solution:} Assume the circuit in the box is modeled by
  $R_T$ and $V_T$. 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Case 1: $V_T/(R_T+5)=2$
  \item Case 2: $(V_T-V)/R_T=3$
  \end{itemize}
  Solving these two equations we get $V_T=20V$, $R_T=5\Omega$
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Case 3: $I=3A$
  \item Case 4: $I=1.5A$
  \end{itemize}

\item {\bf Problem 2. (33 points)} 

  In the circuit below, $V=2V$, $I=2A$, $R_1=3\Omega$, $R_2=2\Omega$,
  $R_3=5\Omega$, $R_5=1\Omega$. Find $R_4$ for it to get maximum power.
  What is the power?

  {\bf Solution:} Find either Thenvenin's or Norton's model for the 
  network excluding $R_5$: $R_T=R_2+R_5=3\Omega$, 
  $V_T=V+I\times R_2=2V+2A\time 2\Omega=6V$, or $I_N=2A$
  Then $R_4=R_T=3\Omega$ will get maximum power $P_R=3W$.

\item {\bf Problem 3. (34 points)}

  Find voltage $V$ and current $I$ as labeled in the following figure:

  \htmladdimg{../midterm1_09sc.gif}

  where $R_1=5\Omega$, $R_2=1\Omega$, $R_3=6\Omega$, $R_4=6\Omega$.

  {\bf Solution:}

  {\bf Method 0, voltage/current source conversion:}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Convert current source 9A and $R_2$ into a voltage source of $9\times 5=45V$
    in series with $R_1=5$. 
  \item Combine $R_1=5$ in series with $R_2=1$ to get $R'=6$ still in series with 
    $V'=45V$. 
  \item Convert this voltage source back to a current source with $I'=45/6$ in 
    parallel with $R'=6$. 
  \item Convert the other voltage source into a current source with $I''=24/6$ in
    parallel with $R''=6$.
  \item Combine the two parallel current sources to get $I'''=I'+I''=(45+24)/6=23/2$
    in parallel with $R'''=R'||R''=3$.
  \item Use current division to find load current $I=I'''/3=23/6$.
  \item Find load voltage $V=IR_4=23$.
  \end{itemize}

  {\bf Method 1, superposition:}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Turn voltage source off:
      \[ I'=9\times\frac{5}{5+(1+6||6)}\frac{1}{2}=2.5A \]
      \[ V'=6I'=15 V \]
    \item Turn current source off:
      \[ I''=\frac{24}{6+(6||6)}\frac{1}{2}=4/3\;A \]
      \[ V''=6I''=8V \]
  \end{itemize}
  The total voltage and current are therefore $V=V''+V''=15+8=23V$,
  $I=I'+I''=23/6A$.

  {\bf Method 2, Thevenin's theorem:}
  
  \[ R_T=6||6=3 \]
  $V_T$ due to 24V:
  \[ V'_T=24-24 \frac{6}{12}=12V \]
  $V_T$ due to 9A:
  \[ V''_T=9\frac{5}{5+7}\times 6=22.5 \]
  Thererfore
  \[ V_T=V'_T+V''_T=34.5 \]
  Reconnecting load $R_4=6$, we get
  \[ V=V_T \frac{6}{6+3}=34.5\times 2/3=23 V \]
  and
  \[ I=V/R_4=23/6 \]

  In the circuit below, $R_5=1\,\Omega$, all other resistors are
  $2\,\Omega$. $V_1=4\,V$, $V_2=8\,V$, $I_1=2\,A$, $I_2=8\,A$.

  (a) Find the voltage $V$ across, current $I$ through, and poswer
  $P$ consumed by $R_7=2\,\Omega$.
  

  (b) If you can change the resistance of $R_7$ for it to consume
  maximum power, what value should it be? What is this power?



  {\bf Solution:} 
  (0) User Thevenin's theorem. Disconnect $R_7$ as the load.

  (1) Convert $I_1=2$ and $R_1=2$ into a voltage source with $V'_1=4\,V$
  in series with $V_1=4\,V$, we get a voltage of $8\,V$ voltage in series 
  with $R_1=2$. 
  
  (2) Convert $V_2=8$ and $R_4=2$ into a current source $I'_2=4\,A$, in 
  parallel with $R_4||R_6=2||2=1,\Omega$. Then turn it back to a voltage 
  source $V'_2=4\,V$ in series with $1,\Omega$. 

  (3) Convert $I_2=8$ and $R_5=1$ into a voltage source of $8\,V$ in series
  with $R_5=1\,\Omega$.

  (4) Combine the two voltage sources in (2) and (3) to get a voltage of 
  $4\,V$ in series with a resistor $R_5+R_4||R_6=2\,\Omega$.

  (5) Combine $8\,V$ and $2\,\Omega$ in (1) with $4\,V$ and $1\,\Omega$ 
  in (4) to get a voltage of $4\,V$ and $1\,\Omega$ to get a voltage of 
  $4\,V$ in series with a resistance of $4\,\Omega$. Find current $I=1\,A$
  in the loop.

  (6) $R_T=1\,\Omega$, $V_T=4+1=6\,V$. The current through $R_7=2\,\Omega$
  is $V_T/(R_T+R_7)=6/3=2\,A$, the voltage across it is $4\,V$, the power
  consumption is $8\,W$

  (7) For $R_7$ as the load to get maximum power, it needs to be 
  $R_7=R_T=1\,\Omega$. The voltage across it is $3\,V$, the current 
  through is $3\,A$, the power consumption is $9\,W$.
